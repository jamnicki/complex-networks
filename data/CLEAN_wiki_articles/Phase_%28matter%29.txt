property transforming one state conversely
two state phase transformed one
another without abrupt changes

solid phase term mechanical behaviour lackstructural order ordinary crystalline solidarrangement atom within resembles liquid liquid crystals
another phase intermediate solid liquidmolecule substance orderly orientationcase smectic liquid crystal even orderly position

instance least nine different polymorph icemanifest different temperature pressure condition take
another example diamond graphite allotrope carbon
graphite composed layer hexagonally arranged carbon atomcarbon atom strongly bound three neighboring atomlayer weakly bound atom neighboring layers
contrast diamond carbon atom strongly bound four
neighboring carbon atom diamond cubic array tetrahedral

ordinary gas phase electron tightly bound atomic
nucleus contrast plasma phase atom dissociated
ie electron separated atomic nucleusdissociation ionization occurs abruptly upon raisingtemperature lowering pressure thus display hallmarks

metastable phases

sometimes substance mixture heated compressed etc
beyond point would normally exhibit phase changewithout actually triggering change example include supercooling
superheating supersaturation

usually polymorph given substance stablespecific range condition example diamond stable form

may individual molecule enough kinetic energy jump
gas phase likewise individual gas molecule may low
enough kinetic energy join molecule liquid phasephenomenon mean given temperature pressure multiple
phase may coexist

example standard condition temperature pressurebowl liquid water dry air evaporate partial

becomes due increased number gaseous water
molecule available recondense fact liquid molecules
aboveaverage kinetic energy removed bowl
result evaporative cooling similar process may occurtype phase boundaries

gibbs phase rule relates number possible phase variabletemperature pressure whether equilibriumreached

emergence universality

one might ask real system exhibit phase sinceactually infinite reason real system contain
thermodynamic fluctuation system far phase
