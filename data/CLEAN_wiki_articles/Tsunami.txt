generation tsunami

tsunami generated sea floor abruptly deformsvertically displaces overlying water large vertical movements
earth crust occur plate boundary subduction
earthquake particularly effective generating tsunamioceanic plate subducted beneath continental plate sometimes
brings lip continental eventually much
stress put lip snap back sending shockwavesearth crust causing tremor sea known undersea

submarine landslide sometimes triggered large
earthquake well collapse volcanic edifice may also disturb
overlying water column sediment rock slide downsloperedistributed across sea floor similarly violent submarine
volcanic eruption uplift water column form tsunami

tsunami surface gravity wave formed displaced
