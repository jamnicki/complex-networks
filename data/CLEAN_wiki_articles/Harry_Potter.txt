theme motifs

one enduring theme throughout series love
portrayed powerful form magicdumbledores belief power allowed harry resist
voldemorts temptation power second encounter
prevented voldemort able posse fifth
encounter eventually lead voldemorts downfall

contrast another major theme series deathbook largely death open death harrys
parent voldemorts obsession conquering deathquest immortality price goal anyone magicunderstand voldemort want conquer death frightened
said rowling fact voldemorts name contains several
possible meaningsmort mean death french latinterm vol could related french word flightcatalan word steal volde also look sound bit like
certain germanic word volk people wald
forest tempting notion vol somehow related
word germanic language pronounced thus word voldemort could also contain meaning death
death wish note also dark lord deliberately renamed
replacing birth name tom riddle choosing namemany possible meaning sinister mustsatisfying rowling seems voldemort
series pit good evil love death voldemorts
pursuit avoid death seen drinking unicorn bloodhalflife splitting soul use horcruxes
contrast lily sacrificial love harry extraordinary
magic act leaf scar voldemort never
understand appreciate well dumbledores constant loveharry

prejudice discrimination also feature prominently throughoutseries harrys education magical world continues learns
wizard witch hate muggles viewinferior lack magical ability furthermoremagical world utilises system designation muggleborn
halfblood pureblood indicate wizard heritageprejudiced within magical community take designation step
viewing system ranking illustrate wizards
worth pureblood preferred sorcerer muggleborns
alternatively known slur mudblood despisedaddition prejudice held fellow human also common
shunning nonhumans even parthumans commonly knownoffensive epithet halfbreeds

another significant recurring theme choice chambersecret dumbledore make perhaps famous statementissue choice harry show truly farability confronts issue goblet fire
tell cornelius fudge one grows farimportant one born

ha many character throughout seriesdumbledore termed choice right easy
ha staple harry potter career hogwarts choices
among character distinguishing trait voldemorts

voldemorts rare gift parseltongueresourcefulness
determination certain disregard rule however harry
unlike voldemort consciously elected embrace friendship
kindness love voldemort knowingly chose reject

matures accumulated experience hogwarts testtrueness ordeal become progressively difficult
keeping line series increasingly darker tonegeneral nature adolescence along line everpresent
theme adolescence whose depiction author purposeful
refusal ignore character sexuality leave harry
put stuck state permanent prepubescence

also recurring throughout harry potter literary motif namely
rowlings frequent use irony satire wordplay folklore
discussing rowlings use name could occupy bookfirst page onward writing displayed ingenuity findingabsolutely right name people place thing spell etcstrong grasp irony multilayered sobriquet voldemort
onomatopoetic grawp hagrids bestial giant halfbrother
