perihelion

postperihelion evolution

perihelion passage comet moved dark skyalthough faded receded sun remained oneprominent object sky towards end september
observer including e barnard began notice comets
nucleus elongated beginning october clear
broken least six fragment observer reportedrelative brightness fragment varied day day

midoctober comet developed notable antitail pointing
towards sun antitails fairly common cometary phenomenon
result orbital geometry giving appearance tail
pointing towards sun although material driven awaysun

comet faded gradually despite fragmentation remained
visible naked eye february ofthe last definite
sighting comet made june

orbital studies
