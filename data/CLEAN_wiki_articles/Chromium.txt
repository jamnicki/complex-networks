applications

us chromium
metallurgy impart corrosion resistance shiny finish 
alloy constituent stainless steel cutlery
chrome plating
anodized aluminium literally turning surfacealuminium ruby
dye paint 
chromiumiii oxide metal polish known green rouge
chromium salt colour glass emerald green
chromium make ruby red therefore usedproducing synthetic rubies
also make brilliant yellow painting
catalyst
chromite used make mold firing bricks
chromium salt used tanning leather
potassium dichromate chemical reagent used cleaning
laboratory glassware titrating agent also usedmordant fixing agent dye fabric
chromiumiv oxide cro used manufacture magnetic tape
higher coercivity iron oxide tape give better
performance
well drilling mud anticorrosive

history

injohann gottlob lehmann found orangered mineral ural
mountain named siberian red lead though misidentifiedlead compound selenium iron component material wafact lead chromate formula pbcro known mineral
crocoite

inpeter simon pallas visited site lehmann found
red lead mineral useful property pigmentpaint use siberian red lead paint pigment developed
rapidly bright yellow made crocoite became colour fashion

innicolaslouis vauquelin received sample crocoite orewa able produce chromium oxide chemical formula cro
mixing crocoite hydrochloric acid invauquelin
discovered could isolate metallic chromium heating oxide
charcoal oven also able detect trace chromiumprecious gemstone ruby emerald

chromium primarily used component paints
tanning salt primary use metal alloyresponsible forof use chromium remainder usedchemical industry refractory foundry industries

chromium named greek word chroma meaning colour
many colorful compound made
biological role

trivalent chromium criii required trace amountsugar metabolism human deficiency cause chromium
deficiency contrast hexavalent chromium toxic
