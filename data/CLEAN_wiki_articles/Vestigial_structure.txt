controversy

vestigial organ used supporting evidence evolution
creationists oppose validity idea question
whether organ actually useless since believe god
gave organism organ specific reason use

question existence vestigial organ usually claimdifferent definition vestigial giving strict interpretationorgan must utterly useless qualify definition often
used dictionary childrens encyclopedia biology textbooks
scientific encyclopedia usually describe organ vestigialdoe serve function modern animal cognate
organ served ancestor even modern organ serfcompletely different usepreadaptation

consider true meaning vestigial completely
without use tend claim meaning changed time
structure thought vestigial found uses
however documentation indicates theory beginningth century vestigial structure invariably understood
sometimes retain potentiality becoming either whollypart functionless thought infrequentlydegenerating organ turned account way
