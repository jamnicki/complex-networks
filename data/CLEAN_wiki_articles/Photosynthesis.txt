photosynthesis occurs two stage first phase lightdependent
reaction photosynthetic reaction also called light reactions
capture energy light use make highenergy molecules
second phase lightindependent reaction also called
calvinbenson cycle formerly known dark reaction use
highenergy molecule capture carbon dioxide make
precursor glucose

factor affecting photosynthesis

three main factor affecting photosynthesis several
corollary factor three mainlight irradiance wavelength
carbon dioxide concentration
temperature

light intensity irradiance wavelength temperature

early frederick frost blackman along gabrielle
matthaei investigated effect light intensityirradiancetemperature rate carbon assimilation
constant temperature rate carbon assimilation varies
irradiance initially increasing irradiance increases
however higher irradiance relationship longer holdrate carbon assimilation reach plateau
constant irradiance rate carbon assimilation increases
temperature increased limited range effect
seen high irradiance level low irradiance
increasing temperature little influence ratecarbon assimilation
