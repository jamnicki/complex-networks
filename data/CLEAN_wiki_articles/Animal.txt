characteristics

animal several characteristic set apartliving thing animal eukaryotic usually multicellular
although see myxozoa separate bacteriaprotist heterotrophic generally digesting foodinternal chamber distinguishes plant algaealso distinguished plant algae fungicell lack cell walls

structure

exception notably sponge phylum porifera
animal body differentiated separate tissue include
muscle able contract control locomotionnervous system sends process signal also
typically internal digestive chamber one two openings
animal sort organization called metazoaneumetazoans former used animal general

animal eukaryotic cell surrounded characteristic
extracellular matrix composed collagen elastic glycoproteins
may calcified form structure like shell bonespicule development form relatively flexible framework
upon cell move reorganized making complex
structure possible contrast multicellular organism like
plant fungi cell held place cell wall develop
progressive growth also unique animal cell following
intercellular junction tight junction gap junctiondesmosomes

reproduction development

nearly animal undergo form sexual reproduction adultdiploid polyploid specialized reproductive cells
undergo meiosis produce smaller motile spermatozoon larger
nonmotile ovum fuse form zygote develop new
individuals

many animal also capable asexual reproduction may take
place parthenogenesis fertile egg produced without
mating case fragmentation

zygote initially develops hollow sphere called blastula
undergoes rearrangement differentiation sponge blastula
larva swim new location develop new spongegroup blastula undergoes complicated rearrangementfirst invaginates form gastrula digestive chamber two
separate germ layersan external ectoderm internal endoderm
case mesoderm also develops germ layers
differentiate form tissue organs

nutrition

animal consumer derive energy producerturn derive energy number sources

animal grow indirectly using energy sunlight plants
use energy convert carbon dioxide simple sugars
using process known photosynthesis starting molecule water photosynthesis convert energysunlight chemical energy stored bond glucose
cho release oxygen sugar used
building block allow plant grow animal eat
plant eat creature eaten plantsugar produced plant used animal either
used directly help animal grow broken releasing stored
solar energy giving animal energy required motion
process known glycolysis

many animal live close hydrothermal vent cold seepsocean floor dependent energy sunlightnourishment instead chemosynthetic archaea eubacteria formbase food chain creature use energy compounds
seeping vent power manufacture sugarmolecule animal live either eating microbeharboring within tissues

origin fossil record
