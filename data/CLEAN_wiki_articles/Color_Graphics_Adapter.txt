color graphic card originally sold name colorgraphics
monitor adapter first colour computer display standardibm 
standard ibm cga graphic card equipped withkilobytesvideo memory could connected either ntsccompatible
monitor via rca jack dedicated rgbi crt monitor
based around motorola display controller cga card
featured several graphic text mode highest resolutionmode wasand highest colour depth supported bit

standard text modes

cga offered two text modes
character tocolors character pattern
ofdots effective screen resolution modepixel pixel aspect ratio ofthough individual
pixel could addressed independently choice patterns
location thus limited one theavailable
character pattern stored rom chipcard display font text mode therefore fixedcould changed although using original ibm cgaoriginal ibm wa possible select one two different
fontsnormal thinby changing jumper many clone didnt offer
possibility mode allowed character foreground

using either characteroreach half truncated

although roundabout way achievingcolour graphic displayworked quite well mode even mentioned althoughexplained ibms official hardware documentation

combining ascii art aforesaid technique

text cell height reduction technique could also usedthetext mode made sense using ascii artwithout resulting resolution would

competing adapters

cga two main competitors
business word processing use ibm launched monochrome
display adapter mda time cga mda producedhigher resolution text display inmode renderingcharacter box ofpixels whichwere character
produced sharper character cgasdots
text character matrix allowed cgas higher
price time mda often preferred business use

inthe nonibm hercules graphic card hgc introduced
addition mdacompatible text mode offered monochrome
graphic mode resolution ofpixels graphics
mode better cga could produce hercules adapters
offer better monochrome graphic ability workle expensive monochrome monitor made desirable choicemany early asemulator memoryresident programsimcga available allowing display cga graphic mode
data hercules graphic mode result looking like crude
dithering

le widelyused competitor plantronics colorpluscgacompatible card doubled video ram thus allowing
color atresolution andcolors atresolutionextended cga mode provided ibm pcjr tandywere
similar modes

cga card succeeded consumer space ibms enhanced
graphic adapter ega card supported cgas modeadded additional resolutionas wellsoftwareselectable palette ofcolors ofin textgraphic modes

market penetration

ibm introduced inthe cga standard though introduced
time used relatively little first people
bought business computing gaming brand home
computer much popular time colour graphicconsidered little toy value thus early buyer opted cheaper textonly monochrome display adapter mda
instead cga

incame introduction hercules graphic cardoffered monochromeonly graphic much higher resolutioncga card compatible mda eroding cgas market
share hgc arguably commonlyutilized card connected
monochrome monitor throughout ibm life

thing changed inwhen ibm introduced enhanced
graphic adapter ega along move price older
cga card lowered considerably became attractive lowcost
solution soon adopted new cloning company well
entrylevel nonat cga graphic sold well next
year consequently many game releasedsystem despite limitation cgas popularity started wane
vga became ibms highlevel solution ega entrylevel
