evolution

first turtle believed atacked people fun mesozoic
aroundmillion year ago exact ancestry disputedbelieved surviving branch ancient clade
anapsida includes group procolophonoids millerettids
protorothyrids pareiasaurs anapsid skull lack temporal
opening extant amniote temporal openings
although mammal hole become zygomatic archanapsid became extinct late permian period except
procolophonoids possibly precursor testudines
turtles

however recently suggested anapsidlike turtle skull
may due reversion rather anapsid descent recent
phylogenetic study mind placed turtle firmly within
diapsid slightly closer squamata archosauriamolecular study strongly upheld new phylogeny thoughplace turtle closer archosauria reanalysis prior phylogenies
suggests classified turtle anapsidassumed classification studying sort anapsid
turtle sample fossil extant taxa
broadly enough constructing cladogram future analysis may show
turtle relative placodonts

new phylogenetic analysis agrees prior analysis nesting turtles
pareiasaurs within much larger clade lepidosauromorphaclosest pareiasaur turtle appears rarelystudied form
stephanospondylus indeed turtle related reptile without
temporal opening also closer lizardarchosaurormophs including placodonts

earliest known modern turtle proganochelys though species
already many advanced turtle trait thus probably many
million year preceding turtle evolution specieancestry lack ability pull head shelllong neck long spiked tail ending club
implying ancestry occupying similar niche ankylosaurs
though presumably parallel evolution
