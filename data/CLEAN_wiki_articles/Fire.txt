fire simply glowing gas combustible particlecarbon plasma hot enough reach high
ionization required plasma electrically neutral highly
ionized gas composed ion electron neutral particles

state matter generated focused concentrationenergy fuel exposed already open flamesun ray focused lens exothermic chemical
reaction usually accompanied intense heat released rapid
loss electron combustible material striking match
fire may visible brilliant glow andor flame may produce
smoke
