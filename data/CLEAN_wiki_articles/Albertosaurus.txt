gorgosaurus libratus

inpaleontologist charles hazelius sternberg recovered another
tyrannosaurid skeleton slightly older sediment albertadinosaur named gorgosaurus libratus inby lawrence lambe
finding difference separate two genus dale russell
declared gorgosaurus junior synonym albertosaurus 
creating new combination albertosaurus libratus extendedtemporal range genus backwards several million yeargeographic range southward hundred kilometers

recent examination albertosaurus gorgosaurus cast doubt
russell proposed synonymy inphil currie colleagues
examined skull two specie came conclusiontwo distinct genus retained although acknowledgedtwo genus sister taxon distinction therefore
rather arbitrary however according currie albertosaurusgorgosaurus similar daspletosaurus tyrannosaurus
almost always retained separate genus addition
several undescribed albertosaurine specimen recoveredpart north america including alaska new mexicocurrie recommended leaving two genus separatediversity clarified author since followed curries
