siege age gunpowder

introduction gunpowder use cannon broughtnew age siege warfare cannon first used early century become significant weapon anotheryears

campaigning army castle defenses

greatest advantage cannon siege weapon waability fire heavier projectile faster often

however new fortification designed withstand gunpowder weapons
soon constructed throughout europe renaissanceearly modern period siege warfare continued dominate conductwar europe

siege gun developed technique assaulting townfortress became well known ritualized attacking army would
surround town town would asked surrendercomply besieging army would surround town temporary

early century italian architect leon battista alberti
wrote treatise entitled aedificatoria theorized methods
building fortification capable withstanding new gunproposed wall built uneven line like teethsaw proposed starshaped fortress low thick walls

however ruler paid attention theory townitaly began building new style latefrench invasion italian peninsula inthat
new fortification built large scale charles viii
invaded italy army ofmen horsedrawn siegetrain
result could defeat virtually city state matterwell defended panic military strategy completely rethought
throughout italian state time strong emphasisnew fortification could withstand modern siege

new style fortress employed

effective way protect wall cannon fire proveddepth increasing width defense angle ensuring
attacker could fire wall oblique angle square
initially wall lowered backed front behindearth tower reformed triangular bastions

design matured trace italienne starshaped fortresses
surrounding town even city outlying defense proveddifficult capture even well equipped army fortress built
style throughout century become fully obsolete
th century still use throughout world warthough modified century warfare

however cost building vast modern fortificationincredibly high often much individual cityundertake many bankrupted process buildingothers siena spent much money fortificationunable maintain army properly lost wars
anyway nonetheless innumerable large impressive fortressbuilt throughout northern italy first decade century resist repeated french invasion became knownwar italy many stand day

new style fortification began spread
italy rest europe particularly francenetherlands spain italian engineer enormous demand
throughout europe especially wartorn areanetherlands became dotted town encircled modern
fortification many year defensive offensive tacticwell balanced leading protracted costly war europenever known involving planning government
involvement

new fortress ensured war rarely extended beyond seriessiege new fortress could easily holdmenattacking army could ignore powerfully fortified position without

end century marshal vauban french military
engineer developed modern fortification pinnacle refining
siege warfare without fundamentally altering ditch would dug
wall would protected glacis bastion would enfiladeattacker also master planning siegevauban siege somewhat slapdash operation vauban refined
besieging science methodical processuninterrupted would break even strongest fortifications

example vaubanstyle fortress north america include fort
mchenry baltimore maryland fort ticonderoga new york statela citadelle quebec city

planning maintaining siege difficult fending one
besieging army must prepared repel sortiebesieged area also attack may try relievedefender thus usual construct line trenchdefense facing direction outermost line knownline contravallation would surround entire besieging armyprotect attacker would first construction effort
besieging army built soon fortress cityinvested line circumvallation would also constructed facing
towards besieged area protect sortiedefender prevent besieged escaping

next line vauban usually placed aboutmeterstarget would contain main battery heavy cannoncould hit target without vulnerableline established work crew would move forward creating another
line atmeters line contained smaller gun final line
would constructed onlytometers fortress line
would contain mortar would act staging area attack
party wall breached would alsosapper working undermine fortress would operate

trench connecting various line besieger couldbuilt perpendicular wall fortress defenders
would clear line fire along whole trench thusline known sap needed sharply jagged

another element fortress citadel usually citadel wamini fortress within larger fortress sometimes designedlast bastion defense often mean protectinggarrison potential revolt city citadel usedwartime peacetime keep resident city line

age past siege decided little fighting
opposing army attacker army poorly served
incurring high casualty direct assault fortress would
entail usually would wait supply insidefortification exhausted disease weakened defenderpoint willing surrender time
disease especially typhus constant danger encamped
army outside fortress often forced premature retreat
siege often army lasted longest

important element strategy besieging army whetherallow encamped city surrender usually preferable
graciously allow surrender save casualty set
example future defending city city allowedsurrender minimal loss life much better city
held long time brutally butchered end
moreover attacking army reputation killingpillaging regardless surrender city defensive
effort would redoubled
