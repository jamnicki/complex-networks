history

ascii developed telegraphic code first entered commercial use
sevenbit teleprinter code promoted bell data service 
bell system previously planned use sixbit code derived
fieldata added punctuation lowercase letterearlier fivebit baudot teleprinter code persuaded insteadjoin asa subcommittee started develop ascii baudot
helped automation sending receiving telegraphic messages
took many feature morse code however unlike morse code
baudot used constantlength code compared earlier telegraph codes
proposed bell code ascii underwent reorderingconvenient sorting especially alphabetization list added
feature device teleprinter bob bemer introduced

variant ascii

computer technology spread throughout world different standards
body corporation developed many variation ascii orderfacilitate expression nonenglish language used
romanbased alphabet one could class variationascii extension although misapply term covervariant including preserve ascii charactermapbit range

petscii code used commodore international bit
system probably unique among post code basedascii instead far common ascii

incompatability interoperability

isothe first attempt remedy proenglishlanguage
bias created compatibility problem since remained bit
characterset made additional code available reassigned
languagespecific variant thus became impossible know
character code represented without knowing variant work
textprocessing system could generally cope one
variant anyway

eventually improved technology brought outofband mean represent
information formerly encoded eighth bit byte
freeing bit add anotheradditional charactercodes new
assignments

example ibm developed bit code page code page 
replaced controlcharacters graphic symbolsmiley face mapped additional graphic character upper 
position operating system supported codepages
manufacturer ibm supported hardware digital
equipment corporation developed multinational character set
decmcs use popular terminal

eightbit standard isoiecderived decmcsmac roman developed true extension ascii leavingoriginal charactermapping intact adding additional values
bit range

enabled representation broader range languagestandard continued suffer incompatibilitylimitation still iso variant window often
mislabeled iso even microsoft software original bit
ascii remain common character encoding use today

unicode fix

unicode isoiecuniversal character set ucs much
