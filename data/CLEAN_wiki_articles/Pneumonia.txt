diagnosis

diagnose pneumonia health care provider rely patients
symptom finding physical examination informationchest xray blood test sputum culture may also helpfulchest xray typically used diagnosis hospitalclinic xray facility however community setting 
general practice pneumonia usually diagnosed based symptomphysical examination alone diagnosing pneumonia difficultpeople especially illness occasionallychest scan test may needed distinguish pneumonia
illnesses

physical examination

individual symptom pneumonia need medical evaluation
physical examination health care provider may reveal feversometimes low body temperature increased respiratory rate low
blood pressure fast heart rate low oxygen saturationamount oxygen blood indicated either pulse oximetry
blood gas analysis people struggling breathe confused
cyanosis bluetinged skin require immediate attention

infectious pneumonia include fungi parasites

viruses

virus must invade cell order reproduce typically virus
reach lung airborne droplet inhaled mouth
nose lung virus invades cell liningairway alveolus invasion often lead cell death either
virus directly kill cell type cell
selfdestruction called apoptosis immune system respondsviral infection even lung damage occurs white blood cells
mainly lymphocyte activate variety chemical cytokineallow fluid leak alveolus combination cell

transportation oxygen bloodstream

addition damaging lung many virus affect organthus disrupt many different body function virus also make
body susceptible bacterial infection reason
bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia

viral pneumonia commonly caused virus influenza virus
respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus metapneumovirus
herpes simplex virus rare cause pneumonia except newborns
people immune system problem also risk pneumonia
caused cytomegalovirus cmv

bacteria

bacteria typically enter lung airborne droplet inhaled
also reach lung bloodstreaminfection another part body many bacteria live parts
upper respiratory tract nose mouth sinuses
easily inhaled alveolus inside alveoli
bacteria may invade space cell alveoli
connecting pore invasion trigger immune systemsend neutrophil type defensive white blood celllung neutrophil engulf kill offending organismalso release cytokine causing general activation immune

pneumonia include haemophilus influenzae klebsiella pneumoniae

type pneumonia

pneumonia classified several different way pathologists
classified according anatomic change foundlung autopsy became knownmicroorganism causing pneumonia microbiologic classification arose
advent xrays radiological classificationdeveloped another important classification system used pneumonia
combined clinical classification combine many factors
including age risk factor certain microorganism presenceunderlying lung disease underlying systemic disease whetherha recently hospitalized

early classification schemes

initial description pneumonia focused anatomic pathologic
appearance lung either direct inspection autopsyappearance microscope lobar pneumonia infection
involves single lobe section lung lobar
pneumonia often due streptococcus pneumoniae multilobar
pneumonia involves one lobe often severe
illness lobar pneumonia interstitial pneumonia involves areas
alveolus may called interstitial
pneumonitis interstitial pneumonia likely causedvirus atypical bacteria

discovery xrays made possible determine anatomic type
pneumonia without direct examination lung autopsy led
development radiological classification early
investigator distinguished typical lobar pneumoniaatypical chlamydophila viral pneumonia using location
distribution appearance opacity saw chest xrays
certain xray finding used help predict courseillness although possible clearly determinemicrobiologic cause pneumonia based xrays alone

advent modern microbiology classification based uponcausative microorganism became possible determiningmicroorganism causing individual pneumonia important step
deciding treatment type length sputum culture blood cultures
test respiratory secretion specific blood test useddetermine microbiologic classification laboratory
testing typically take several day microbiologic classificationusually possible time initial diagnosis

combined clinical classification

traditionally clinician classified pneumonia clinical
characteristic dividing acute three weeks
duration chronic pneumonia useful chronic
pneumonia tend either noninfectious mycobacterial fungal
mixed bacterial infection caused airway obstruction acute
pneumonia divided classic bacterial
bronchopneumonia streptococcus pneumoniae atypical
pneumonia interstitial pneumonitis mycoplasma
pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae aspiration pneumonia
syndromes

combined clinical classification commonly used
classification scheme attempt identify person risk factors

selection appropriate initial treatment evenmicrobiologic cause pneumonia known two broad
category pneumonia scheme communityacquired pneumonia
hospitalacquired pneumonia

prognosis mortality

treatment type bacterial pneumonia cured within
one two week viral pneumonia may last longer mycoplasmal
pneumonia may take four six week resolve completelyeventual outcome episode pneumonia depends illperson first diagnosed one way predict outcome
use pneumonia severity score curb score takes

advanced health care system pneumonia even deadlier limited
access clinic hospital limited access xrays limited
antibiotic choice inability treat underlying conditions
inevitably lead higher rate death pneumonia

prevention

several way prevent infectious pneumonia appropriately
treating underlying illness aid decrease persons
risk pneumonia smoking cessation importanthelp limit lung damage also cigarette smoke interferes
many body natural defense pneumonia

research show several way prevent pneumonianewborn infant testing pregnant woman group streptococcuschlamydia trachomatis giving antibiotic treatment needed

vaccination important preventing pneumonia childadult vaccination haemophilus influenzae streptococcus
