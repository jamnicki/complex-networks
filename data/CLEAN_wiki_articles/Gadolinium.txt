notable characteristics

gadolinium silvery white malleable ductile rare earth metal
metallic luster crystallizes hexagonal closepacked
alpha form room temperature heated tok transforms
beta form bodycentered cubic structure

unlike rare earth element gadolinium relatively stabledry air however tarnish quickly moist air form loosely
adhering oxide spall expose surface oxidation
gadolinium reacts slowly water soluble dilute acid

gadolinium highest thermal neutron capture crosssectionknown elementbarns also fast burnout rate
limiting usefulness nuclear control rod material

gadolinium becomes superconductive critical temperaturek strongly magnetic room temperature exhibits
ferromagnetic property room temperature
