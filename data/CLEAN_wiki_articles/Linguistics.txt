variation

substantial part linguistic investigation naturedifference among language world naturevariation important understanding human linguistic
ability general human linguistic ability narrowly
constrained biological property specie languages
must similar human linguistic ability unconstrained
language might vary greatly

different way interpret similarity among languages
example latin language spoken roman developedspanish spain italian italy similarity spanishitalian many case due descended latinprinciple two language share property property might
either due common inheritance due propertyhuman language faculty

often possibility common inheritance essentially ruled
given fact learning language come quite easilyhuman assumed language spoken leastlong biologically modern human probably least
fifty thousand year independent measure language changeexample comparing language ancient text daughter
language spoken today suggest change rapid enough makeimpossible reconstruct language spoken long agoconsequence common feature language spoken different
part world normally taken evidence common
ancestry

even striking documented case sign languagedeveloped community congenitally deaf people couldexposed spoken language property sign languages
shown conform generally many propertyspoken language strengthening hypothesis properties
due common ancestry general characteristicway language learned

loosely speaking collection property languages
share referred asuniversal grammar however
much debate around topic term used several
different ways

universal property language may partly due universal aspects
human experience example human experience waterfact human language word water probablyunrelated fact challenging question regarding universal
grammar generally require one control factor clearly
experience part process individual learn languages
experience enough since animal raised around
people learn extremely little human language
interesting example suppose human languages
distinguish noun verb generally believed true
would require sophisticated explanation since nounverb exist world apart language make use
general property could due general propertyhuman cognition due property human cognitionspecific language little understood human cognitiongeneral allow meaningful distinction made result
generalization often stated theoretical linguistics withoutstand taken whether generalization could bearing
aspect cognition

property language

ha understood since time ancient greeklanguage tend organized around grammatical categorynoun verb nominative accusative present pastvocabulary grammar language organized aroundfundamental categories

addition making substantial use discrete category language
ha important property organizes element recursive
structure allows example noun phrase contain another
noun phrase chimpanzee lip clause containclause think raining though recursion grammar
wa implicitly recognized much earlier example jespersenimportance aspect language fully realizedpublication noam chomsky book syntactic structurepresented formal grammar fragment english priordetailed description linguistic system phonological
morphological system tend closed admit little
creativity

chomsky used contextfree grammar augmented transformations
since contextfree grammar written substantial
fragment various language example gpsg englishha demonstrated human language include crossserial
dependency cannot handled adequately contextfree
grammar requires increased power example transformations

speech appears human universal whereasmany culture speech community lack written
communication
