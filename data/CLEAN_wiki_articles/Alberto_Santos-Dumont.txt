rather relatively smooth firm parkland availablesantosdumont reflection aerodynamic weaknessdesign accordingly catapult used huffman prairie allowed
use relatively short ground rail thus avoidingtimeconsuming drudgery positioning hundred foot rail needed
launch without catapult

supporter wright flyer claim also point thatalthoughstiff head wind required aircraft moved power
wright first develop effective aircraft control
made practical flight possible even breezy windy

experience project painstaking research original documents
photograph artifact original flyer conducted much like
