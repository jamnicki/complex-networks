biofuel fuel derived biomassrecently living
organism metabolic byproduct manure cowrenewable energy source unlike natural resourcepetroleum coal nuclear fuels

one definition biofuel fuel anminimum contentvolume material derived living organism harvested withinten year preceding manufacture

like coal petroleum biomass form stored solar energyenergy sun captured process photosynthesis
growing plant see also system ecology one advantage biofuel
comparison fuel type biodegradable thus
relatively harmless environment spilledyearsfall petrochemical fuel intro petroleum fossil fuel factinexhaustible source current life depends petroleum yet
use faster make sustain current lifeusage alternative fuel replacement petroleum critical
alternative fuel much healthier nature community
corn fuel cooking oil also inexhaustible alternatealternate fuel pro deciding factor among manyswitch alternate source petrochemical cause many smog
problem city suburb surround therefore causing
child adult alike health issue alternative fuel
source much healthier cornbased fuel called gasohol
also unlike petrochemical alternative fuel sourceunlimited use alternative fuel corn soybean fuel
increase economy decrease amount money
send middle east oil also cost much lediesel quick breakdown vegetable par alternative fuel
also decrease smog problem place like california new
york city chicago

whats available currently already alternative fuelmarket though hard locate vegetable oil one good
source fuel even bus vegetable oil fuel
travel country promoting usage alternative fuels
also vegetable oil isusually gathered cooperating restaurant 
quick breakdown vegetable paranother fuel sourcegasohol made soybean corn also cooking oil
general work fuel impact inthe clean air actinstated protection environment society
vegetable oil biodiesel virtually sulfur freequick
breakdown vegetable parswitching alternative fuel would
support act would also stop export moneymiddle east start paying ourtrillion dollar debt
would affect petroleumbased fuel companyadapt betterment country would also hurtmiddle east economy though true use corn soybean
fuel spike specifically mid west economy
upward would also promote farmer work would increase

sugar cane biofuel

agricultural product specifically grown use biofuels include
corn soybean primarily united state well flaxseed
rapeseed primarily europe sugar cane brazil palm oilsoutheast asia biodegradable output industry agriculture
forestry household also used produce bioenergy
example include straw timber manure rice husk sewage
biodegradable waste food leftover feedstock converted
biogas anaerobic digestion biomass used fuel often
consists underutilized type like chaff animal waste

fire made carefully tofor custom designed
charcoal stove inefficient use fuel may minor causedeforestation though negligible compared deliberate
destruction clear land agricultural use importantlymean work put gathering fuel thusquality cooking stove direct influence viabilitybiofuels

direct biofuel

direct biofuels biofuels used existing unmodified
petroleum engine engine technology change time
exactly direct biofuel hard define fuelwork without problem one unmodified engine may work another
engine general newer engine sensitive fuel older
engine new engine also likely designedamount biofuel mind

straight vegetable oil used older diesel enginewarmest climate used without engine modificationlimited use colder climate commonly turned
biodiesel engine manufacturer explicitly allows usevegetable oil engines

biodiesel direct biofuel however current manufacturer
cover engine warranty forbiodieselallowedin past appears change emission
standard reason dont today official
statement exists many people run thousand mile biodiesel
without problem many study made onbiodiesel

butanol often claimed direct replacement gasolinewide spread production time engine manufacturers
made statement use paper lab
test appears butanol sufficiently similar characteristics
gasoline work without problem gasoline
engine widespread experience exists

ethanol common biofuel year many engines
designed run many could run regular
gasoline open debate ethanol direct replacementengine thoughthey cannot run anything else late
engine started appearing design use either fuel
ethanol direct replacement engine debatable
engine unmodified factory modified ethanol

small amount biofuel often blended traditional fuelbiofuel portion fuel direct replacement fuel
