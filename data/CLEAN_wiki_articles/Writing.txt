year required learn major disadvantagelogographic system alphabetic system however efficiencyreading logographic writing learned major advantage

writing system wholly logographic phonetic components
well logogram logosyllabic component case chinese
cuneiform mayan glyph may stand morphemesyllable logoconsonantal case hieroglyphmany ideographic component chinese radical hieroglyphic
determiner example mayan glyph fin pronounced
ka used represent syllable whenever clarification
wa needed however phonetic element complement logographic
element rather vice versa

unlike true syllabary independent glyphsyllable

sometimes term alphabet restricted system separate
