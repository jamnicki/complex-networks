example

consider following payoff matrix describing coordination game

ab
b
coordination game

strategy es since player cannot invadepopulation player player invade population player two pure strategy nash equilibrium correspondtwo second game also two pure strategy nash
equilibrium one corresponds ess

c
simple game

nash equilibrium since neither player better
unilaterally deviating consider player
introduced population player player doe equally
well population scoreshowever playerbetter scoresthan population doec player thus player invade populationplayers

even game pure strategy nash equilibrium might case

es human behaviour

recent controversial science sociobiology evolutionary
psychology attempt explain animal human behaviour social
structure largely term evolutionarily stable strategies
sociopathy chronic antisocialcriminal behaviour suggested
best explained combination two strategies

although originally considered stable state biological
evolution need limited context fact esstable state large class adaptive dynamic result ess
used explain human behavior without presuming behaviour
