type system

type system defines programming language classifies valueexpression type manipulate typeinteract generally includes description data structures
constructed language design study type
system using formal mathematics known type theory

internally data modern digital computer stored simplyzero onesbinary data typically represent informationreal world name bank account measurementlowlevel binary data organized programming languagehighlevel concept data type also abstract types
whose purpose warn programmer semantically
meaningless statement verify safety property programs

language classified respect type systems

typed untyped languages

language typed operation defined one data type cannotperformed value another data type example text
quote string programming languages
dividing number string meaning modern programming
language therefore reject program attempting performoperation language meaningless operationdetected program compiled static type checkingrejected compiler others detectedprogram run dynamic type checking resulting runtime
exception

opposition untyped language assembly languages
allows operation performed data type highlevel
language untyped include bcpl variety forth

practice language considered typed pointview type theory verifying rejecting operationmodern language offer degree typing many production languages
provide mean bypass subvert type system

static dynamic typing

static typing expression type determined priorprogram run typically compiletime exampleand
integer expression cannot passed functionexpects string stored variable defined hold
dates

staticallytyped language manifestly typed typeinferredfirst case programmer must explicitly write type certain
textual position example variable declarationsecond case compiler infers type expressiondeclaration based context mainstream staticallytyped
language java manifestly typed complete type
inference traditionally associated mainstream
language haskell however many manifestly typed
language support partial type inference example java cinfer type certain limited cases

dynamic typing also called latent typing determines typesafety
operation runtime word type associatedruntime value rather textual expression typeinferred
language dynamically typed language require programmerwrite explicit type annotation expression among things
may permit single variable refer value different types
different point program execution however type errors
cannot automatically detected piece code actually
executed making debugging difficult lisp javascript python
dynamically typed

weak strong

weak typing allows value one type treated anotherexample treating string number occasionally useful
also cause bug language often termed unsafe c assembly language often described weakly typed

strong typing prevents attempting mix type raiseerror stronglytyped language often termed typesafe safemake bug impossible ada python strongly
typed

alternate definition weakly typed refers languageperl javascript permit large number implicit type
conversion perl particular characterized dynamically
typed programming language type checking take placeruntime see type system capability often usefuloccasionally dangerous would permit operation whose objectchange type demand

strong static generally considered orthogonal conceptusage literature differs use term strongly typedmean strongly statically typed even confusingly mean
simply statically typed thus ha called strongly typedweakly statically typed

execution semantics

data specified machine must instructed perform
operation data execution semantics language defines
various construct language produceprogram behaviour

example semantics may define strategy expressions
evaluated value manner control structures
conditionally execute statements

core library

programming language associated core library sometimes
known standard library especially included part
published language standard conventionally made
available implementation language core libraries
typically include definition commonly used algorithm data
structure mechanism input output

language core library often treated part languageuser although designer may treated separate
entity many language specification define core must made
available implementation case standardized
language core library may required linelanguage core library therefore differs languagelanguage indeed language designed meaningcertain syntactic construct cannot even described without referring
core library example java string literal defined
instance javalangstring class similarly smalltalk
anonymous function expression block construct instancelibrary blockcontext class conversely scheme contains multiple
coherent subset suffice construct rest languagelibrary macro language designer even bother say
portion language must implemented language
construct must implemented part library

practice

language designer user must construct number artifacts
govern enable practice programming important
artifact language specification implementation

specification

specification programming language intended providedefinition language user implementors use interpret
behaviour program reading source code

programming language specification take several form including
following
explicit definition syntax semantics language
syntax commonly specified using formal grammar semantic
definition may written natural language c
language formal semantics standard scheme
specifications
description behaviour translator language
eg fortran syntax semanticslanguage inferred description maywritten natural formal language
model implementation sometimes written languagespecified prolog syntax semantics language
explicit behaviour model implementation

implementation

implementation programming language provides way execute
program one configuration hardware software
broadly two approach programming language
implementation compilation interpretation generally
possible implement language using techniques

output compiler may executed hardware program
called interpreter implementation make useinterpreter approach distinct boundary compiling
interpreting instance implementation basic
programming language compile execute source linetime

program executed directly hardware usually run several
order magnitude faster interpreted software

one technique improving performance interpreted programjustintime compilation virtual machine monitorsequence bytecode frequently executed translatesmachine code direct execution hardware
