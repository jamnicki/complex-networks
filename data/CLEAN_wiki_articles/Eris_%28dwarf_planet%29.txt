unlike somewhat reddish pluto triton however eris appears
almost grey pluto reddish colour believed due deposits
tholins surface deposit darken surface
lower albedo lead higher temperature evaporationmethane deposit contrast eris far enough away sun
methane condense onto surface even albedolow condensation methane uniformly surface reducesalbedo contrast would cover deposit red tholins
