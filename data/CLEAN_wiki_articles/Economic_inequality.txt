one major reason economic inequality within modern
market economy wage determined markethence influenced supply demand view inequalitycaused difference supply demand different types
work

job many willing worker high supplysmall number position low demand result low wagejob competition worker drivewage example would lowskill job dishwashing
customer service persistence unemploymentmarket economy fact job require little skill
result high supply willing worker contrary wiselimited number job available competition amongst worker tend
drive wage since one worker demand higher wage
employer simply hire another employee equally low wage

job willing worker low supply large
demand skill worker result high wagejob competition employer drivewage example would highskill job engineers
capable ceo competition amongst employer tend drive wages
since one employer demand low wage worker simply
quit easily find new job higher wage

example tend identify skill high demandwage necessarily case example highly skilled
computer programmer western country seen wages
suppressed competition computer programmer indiawilling accept lower wage

final result amongst supply demand interactiongradation different wage representing income inequality within
society

innate ability

many people believe connection differenceinnate ability intelligence strength charismaindividual level wealth relating innate
ability back labour market suggests innate abilities
high demand relative supply hence play large role
increasing wage contrariwiseinnate ability might also affect individual ability operate
within society general regardless labour market

education

one important factor creation inequality variable
ability individual get education education especially
education area high demand worker creates
high wage education contrariwiseunable afford education generally receive much lower wage many
economist believe major reason world experienced
increasing level inequality sinceincrease demand highly skilled worker hightech
industry believe resulted increase wages
education increased wagewithout education leading greater inequality

gender race culture

existence different gender race culture within society
also thought contribute economic inequality scientistrichard lynn argue innate group differenceability partially responsible producing race gender
group difference wealth see also race intelligence sexintelligence

idea gender gap try explain reasondifferent level income different gender culture religion

wealth condensation

wealth condensation theoretical process certain
condition newlycreated wealth tends become concentratedpossession alreadywealthy individual entityreflected common saying rich get richer poor get
pooreraccording theory already hold wealthmean invest new source creating wealth otherwise
leverage accumulation wealth thus beneficiarynew wealth time wealth condensation significantly contribute
persistence inequality within society

example wealth condensation truck drivertruck consistently make money sinceowner truck escape rent charged driver owner even
taking account maintenance cost hence truck driver
ha wealth begin afford buy truck order
make money truck driver doe truck makes
lesser wage therefore stuck catch unable buytruck increase income

related wealth condensation effect inter generational
inequality noted rich tend provideoffspring better education increasing chanceachieving high amount income furthermore wealthy often leave
offspring hefty inheritance jump starting processwealth condensation next generation

mitigating factors

many factor tend constrain amount economic
inequality within society progressive taxation richtaxed poor effective reducing amount income

perspective regarding economic inequality

various school thought regarding economic inequality

marxism

marxism favor eventual communist society distributionbased individual need rather ability produce
social class inheritance factor system
inequality would low nonexistent assuming everyoneneeds

liberalism

classical liberal libertarian generally take stancewealth inequality believe equality law regardlesswhether lead unequal wealth distribution ludwig von mises
explains liberal champion equality law fully
aware fact men born unequal precisely
inequality generates social cooperation civilization
equality law opinion designed correctinexorable fact universe make natural inequality
disappear contrary device secure whole
mankind maximum benefit derive henceforthmanmade institution prevent man attaining station
best serve fellow citizens

libertarian robert nozick argued government redistributes wealth
force usually form taxation ideal moral
society would one individual free force

however nozick recognized modern economic inequalityresult forceful taking property certain amountredistribution would justified compensate forceinequality john rawls arguedtheory justice inequality distribution wealthjustified improve society whole includingleast well member rawls doe full implicationtheory justice

see rawlss argument justification capitalism since even
poorest member society theoretically benefit increased

inequality long cause mainly due differences
behavior inequality provides incentive push society

believe economic freedom important economic
equality

another argument inequality doe necessarily meanpoverty although poverty bad inequality badthus policy considered good make wealthy
people wealthy without making anyone poor althoughincrease total amount inequality

third argument capitalism especially free market capitalism

party indeed better transaction assuming
