map showing area scandinavian settlement eighth dark red
ninth red tenth orange eleventh yellow century green
denotes area subjected frequent viking raids

viking expansion took place much debated topic nordic
history clear answers

one common theory viking homeland overpopulatedgrowing poulation lacking ability agriculture support
existing population caused lack land people
living near coast possession good naval technologymake sense expand overseas course typical youth bulge
effect one problem explanation resultlack source rise population decline agricultural
production proven theory widely accepted partsolution since hard imagine people would colonise
new territory lack land home howeverdoe little explain plundering raid trading expeditionexpansion went overseas country big
uncultivated forest area viking homeland scandinavian
peninsula

another explanation viking used temporary weaknessregion travelled instance danish viking aware
internal division empire charlemagne begunresulted splitting empire danish
expedition england also profited dissunitydifferent english kingdoms

decline old trade route also part explanation
trade western europe rest eurasian continent
suffered severe decline result fall roman
empire century expansion islam century time viking trade mediterranean sea
wa lowest level instance trading fur slaves
silver spice arab trading silver
spice weapon frank viking acted likemiddlehand international trade picking roledeclining mediterranian trade previously filled

another important factor come trade destruction
frisian fleet frank gave vikingopportunity take old market however explanation
underlining dissunity one underlining trade explainsexpansion possible occurredconsider addition economic factor also another
reason first viking raid could also originate resistance
forced christianization particular charlemagne persecutions
pagan people accept conversionmassacre
