variability algol first recorded inby geminiano
montanari probable property noticed long
time first person propose mechanismvariability star british amateur astronomer john
goodricke mayhe presented finding royal society
suggesting periodic variability caused dark body
passing front star else star darker
region periodically turned toward earth reportwa awarded copley medal

inthe harvard astronomer edward pickering presented evidence
algol actually eclipsing binary confirmedyear later inwhen potsdam astronomer hermann vogel found
periodic doppler shift spectrum algol infering variations
radial velocity binary system thus algol became onefirst known spectroscopic binaries
