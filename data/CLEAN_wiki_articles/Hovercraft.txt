mid british engineer sir john isaac thornycroft
built number ground effect machine test model based idea
using air hull boat water reduce drag
although filed number patent involving airlubricated hullpractical application found year various
people tried various method using air reduce drag

experimental aircushion boat fast attack craft highspeed
torpedo boat first prototype designated simple
design consisted two small wooden catamaran powered
three prop engine two radial aeroengines installed
