familiar many classifying texture heavy light light soils
lower clay content heavy soil often drain betterdry sooner giving lighter colour lighter soillower moisture content better structure take effort turn

soil colour first impression one viewing soil striking
color contrasting pattern especially memorable red river

mix soil activity decrease size peds formgranular crumb structure structure allows good porosity
easy movement air water combination ease tillage
good moisture airhandling capability good structureplanting germination definitive good tilth

soil texture refers sand silt clay composition combination
gravel largermaterial content sand silt product
physical weathering clay product chemical
weathering clay content particularly influential soil behaviour
due high retention capacity nutrient water duesuperior aggregation clay soil resist wind water erosion better
silty sandy soil mediumtextured soil clay tendmove downward soil profile accumulate subsoil
lightertextured surface soil responsive management

texture influence many physical aspect soil behaviour available
water capacity increase silt importantly clay content
nutrientretention capacity tends follow relationship
plant growth many rely soil tends favour
