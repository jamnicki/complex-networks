erupted magma contains high percentageof silica
lava called felsic
felsic lava rhyolite tend highly viscousfluid erupted dome short stubby flows
viscous lava tend form stratovolcanoes lava domes

real consensus among volcanologists defineactive volcano lifespan volcano vary monthseveral million year making distinction sometimes meaningless
compared lifespan human even civilizationexample many earth volcano erupted dozen timepast thousand year currently showing signeruption given long lifespan volcanoactive lifespan however complicatingdefinition volcano become restless producing earthquakes
