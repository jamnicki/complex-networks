diamond structure form remains topic debate
first researcher supposed consisted nitrogenlater conclusion reached center duemicroscopic platelet platelet connected peaks
theory remained twenty year v sobolev
offered theory two nitrogen atom bonded strongly
together molecular pair replacing carbon diamond
