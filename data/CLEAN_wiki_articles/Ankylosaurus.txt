binomial name

ankylosaurus magniventris
brown 

ankylosauruspronounced kloss kaloss
meaning stiffened lizard genus ankylosaurid dinosaur
containing one specie magniventris fossil ankylosaurusfound geologic formation dating end cretaceous
period western north america

although complete skeleton discovered severalspecie represented extensive fossil material ankylosaurus
often considered archetypal armored dinosaurankylosaurids shared wellknown feature like heavilyarmored
body massive bony tail club ankylosaurus largest

lizard bone probably overlain tough horny
layer keratin osteoderms ranged greatly size wide

tail club

famous tail club ankylosaurus also composed several large
osteoderms fused last tail vertebraheavy supported last seven tail vertebrainterlocked form stiff rod base club thick tendons
preserved attached vertebra tendons
partially ossified bony elastic allowing
great force transmitted end tail swung
seems active defensive weapon capable producing
enough devastating impact break bone assailantha also proposed tail club acted decoyhead although idea largely discredited

found formation however ankylosaurus edmontonia seem
separated geographically ecologically
ankylosaurus wide muzzle perhaps used nonselective grazing

edmontonia narrower muzzle indicating selective
diet seems lived lower elevation closer coast

classification

ankylosaurus named type genus family ankylosauridae
ankylosaurids member larger taxon ankylosauria also
contains nodosaurids ankylosaur phylogeny contentious topic
several mutually exclusive analysis presented recent yearexact position ankylosaurus within ankylosauridae unknown
ankylosaurus euoplocephalus often thought sister taxa
however analysis found genus different positions
discovery research may clarify situation
