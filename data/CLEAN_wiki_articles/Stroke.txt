type stroke

stroke classified two major category ischemichemorrhagic ischemia due thrombosis embolism systemic
hypoperfusion hemorrhage due intracerebral hemorrhagesubarachnoid hemorrhageof stroke due ischemia

ischemic stroke

ischemic stroke cause approximatelyof
stroke blood vessel becomes occluded blood supply part
brain totally partially blocked ischemic strokecommonly divided thrombotic stroke embolic stroke systemic
hypoperfusion watershed border zone stroke venous thrombosis

thrombotic stroke

type depending type vessel thrombus formedlarge vessel disease involves common internal carotids
vertebral circle willis disease may form thrombi
large vessel include descending incidence
atherosclerosis

noninflammatory vasculopathy
moyamoya syndrome
fibromuscular dysplasia
small vessel disease involves intracerebral artery branches

embolic stroke

embolic stroke refers blockage arterial access partbrain embolusa traveling particle debrisarterial bloodstream originating elsewhere embolusfrequently blood clot also plaque brokenatherosclerotic blood vessel number substance including
fat bone marrow broken bone air even cancerous
cell another cause bacterial embolus released infectious
endocarditis

embolus arises elsewhere local therapy solvesproblem temporarily thus source embolus mustidentified embolic blockage sudden onset symptoms
usually maximal start also symptom may transientembolus lysis move different location dissipates
altogether embolic stroke divided four categories

potential cardiac aortic source transthoracic
transesophageal echocardiogram
arterial source
unknown source

high risk cardiac cause include

potential cardiac cause include
mitral annular calcification
patent foramen ovale
atrial septal aneurysm
atrial septal aneurysm patent foramen ovale
left ventricular aneurysm without thrombus
isolated left atrial smoke echocardiography mitral stenosis
