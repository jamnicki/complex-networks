caused cambrian explosion

understanding cambrian explosion happened revolves
around three major theme extrinsic forcing eventenvironmental change intrinsic mechanism acquisition
complex genome iii intrinsic mechanism natural
consequence metazoan ecology

role oxygen

first class explanation far popular dating back
least nursall animal evolvebeginning cambrian low atmospheric oxygen low
oxygen level could prevent animal evolving either preventing

level towe limit however likely wouldphysiological constraint animal living low oxygen environments
today tend low diversity thin shell low metabolic
activity whilst oxygen level thus certainly effectanimal life currently clear atmospheric leveloxygen close proterozoic extent
available oxygen sequestered away reduced mineral compoundadaptation purported proterozoic animal low oxygen
condition presumably like many living animal possessed
effective anaerobic metabolic pathways

developmental mechanisms
