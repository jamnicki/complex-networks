diagnosis

way diagnose case anaemia blood test
generally clinician order full blood count apart reporting
number red blood cell hemoglobin level automatic
counter also measure size red blood cell flow
cytometry important tool distinguishingcause anaemia visual examination blood smear alsohelpful sometimes necessity region worldautomated analysis accessible

modern counter four parameter rbc count hemoglobin
concentration mcv rdw measured allowing others hematocrit
mch mchc calculated compared value adjusted age
sex male hemoglobin level suggestive anaemia
usually thangdl female 
gdl

depending clinical philosophy whether hospital automated
counter immediately add initial testclinician attitude towards ordering test reticulocyte count may
ordered either part initial workup followup

diet anaemia

consumption food rich iron essential prevention iron
