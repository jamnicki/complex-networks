biosphere

modern ecologist ecology studied several levels
population level individual specie biocoenosis level
community specie ecosystem level biosphere level

outer layer planet earth divided several
compartment hydrosphere sphere water lithospheresphere soil rock atmosphere sphere air
biosphere sphere life sometimes described fourth
envelope living matter planet portionplanet occupied life reach well three spheres
although permanent inhabitant atmosphere relative

main question studying ecosystemwhether colonization barren area could carriedinvestigation ecosystem dynamic changes

especially provision healthy water

ecosystem often classified reference biotopes concerned
following ecosystem may defined
continental ecosystem forest ecosystem meadow
ecosystem steppe savanna agroecosystems

oceanic ecosystems

another classification done reference communities

dynamic stability

ecological factor affect dynamic change populationspecie given ecology environment usually divided two
group abiotic biotic

abiotic factor geological geographical hydrologicalclimatological parameter biotope environmentally uniform
region characterized particular set abiotic ecological factors
specific abiotic factor include
water time essential element lifemilieu
air provides oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide living
specie allows dissemination pollen spores
soil time source nutriment physical support
soil salinity nitrogen phosphorus content abilityretain water density influential
temperature exceed certain extreme eventolerance heat significant species
light provides energy ecosystemphotosynthesis
natural disaster also considered abiotic

biocenose community group population plant animals

biotic ecological factor also influence biocenose viabilityfactor considered either intraspecific interspecific

ecosystem lead concept biome

biome homogeneous ecological formation exists large

biome correspond rather well subdivision distributed alonglatitude equator towards pole difference based
physical environment example ocean mountain ranges

ecological crisis

generally ecological crisis occurs loss adaptive
capacity resilience environment speciepopulation evolves way unfavourable coping perturbations
interfere ecosystem landscape specie survival

may environment quality degrades compared species
need change abiotic ecological factor exampleincrease temperature significant rainfalls
may environment becomes unfavourable survivalspecie population due increased pressure predation
example overfishing
lastly may situation becomes unfavourablequality life specie population due risenumber individualsoverpopulation

ecological crisis may brutal occurring withinmonth taking long million year alsonatural anthropic origin may relate one unique speciemany specie see article extinction event

lastly ecological crisis may local oil spill global
rise sea level due global warming

lastly ecological crisis cause extinction alsosimply reduce quality life remaining individual thus
