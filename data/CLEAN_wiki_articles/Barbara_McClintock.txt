mcclintock widely credited discovering transposition following
discovery process bacteria yeast lateearly period molecular biology developed
significant new technology scientist able showmolecular basis transposition scientist cloned shown class transposon accomplete transposon produce functional transposaserequired element move within genome mutation
transposase gene mean cannot move without
another source transposase thus mcclintock observed cannot
