regulation sleep

cycle sleep wakefulness regulated brain stem
thalamus external stimulus various hormone producedhypothalamus neurohormone neurotransmitter highly
correlated sleep wake state example melatonin levels
highest night hormone appears promote
sleep adenosine nucleotide involved generating energybiochemical process gradually accumulates human brainwakefulness though decrease sleep researcher believeaccumulation day encourages sleep stimulant properties
caffeine attributed negating effect adenosine
however role adenosine far proven mouse lacking
adenosine receptor display normal sleep pattern normal responses
sleep deprivation

suprachiasmatic nucleus scn hypothalamus playimportant role also generates rhythm isolationpresence light sends message pineal gland instruct
cease secreting melatonin

thus three process influenced hormonal neurologicalenvironmental factor underlie sleep regulation

anthropology sleep

recent research suggests sleep pattern vary significantly across
culture striking difference societyplentiful source artificial light one primary
difference appears prelight culture brokensleep pattern example people might sleep far quickly
sun set would wake several time throughoutnight punctuating sleep period wakefulness perhaps
lasting several hour boundary sleeping wakingblurred society observer believe sleepsociety often split two main period first
characterised primarily slow sleep second rem sleep
called segmented sleep led expression first
sleep watch second sleep appear literatureworld preindustrial societies

society display fragmented sleep pattern people sleep
time day night shorter period example
many mediterranean society siesta people sleepperiod afternoon many nomadic huntergatherer societies
people sleep throughout day night dependinghappening

plentiful artificial light available industrialised
west since least midnineteenth century sleep patternchanged significantly everywhere lighting introducedgeneral people sleep concentrated burst night
sleep much later although always true

society people generally sleep least oneperson often many animal others people rarely sleepanyone intimate relation spouse almostsociety sleeping partner strongly regulated social standards
example people might sleep immediate family
extended family spouse child childcertain age child specific gender peer certain gender
friend peer equal social rank one sleep may
actively social time depending sleep groupingconstraint noise activity

people sleep variety location sleep directlyground others skin blanket others sleep platform beds
sleep blanket pillow simple head
rest head support choice shaped variety
factor climate protection predator housing type
technology incidence pests

clothing worn sleep varies across individual culture many
people wear pajama nightshirt regular day underwear
clothes wore day changing clothesmorning sleep nude
