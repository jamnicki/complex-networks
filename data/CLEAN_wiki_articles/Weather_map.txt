type analysis performed

isobaric analysis

isobaric analysis involves construction line equal mean
sea level pressure isobar geographic map innermost
closed line indicate position relative maximum minimumpressure field minimum called low pressure areamaximum called high pressure area high depicted blue low depicted red trough low pressuredepicted thick brown dashed line elongation lower
pressure

isotach analysis

upper level jet streak div area region divergence aloft
lead surface convergence aid cyclogenesis
upper level jet streak div area region divergence aloft
lead surface convergence aid cyclogenesis

isotachs line equal wind speed drawn weather maphelpful finding maximum minimum wind pattern minimumwind pattern aloft favorable tropical cyclogenesis maximumwind pattern various level atmosphere show locationupper level jet stream low level jet playrole severe weather certain quadrant upper level wind maxima
area upward vertical motion preferred

isotherm analysis

isotherm line equal temperature drawn weather maps
isotherm drawn normally solid line preferred temperature
interval easily show area temperature gradientuseful finding front located normally warm edgetemperature gradient also show area freezing
useful determination precipitation type
