sumo contrast eastern martial arts

sumo considered martial art diverges typical eastern
style surface heart whereas martial arts
award promotion time practice sumo pure meritocracy
rank gained lost every two month official
tournament conversely common japanese martial artkarate rank gained passing single testpractitioner karate normally demoted even repeated
poor performance tournament divergence martial
art creates highpressure highintensity environment sumo
wrestler benefit sekitori wrestler receivetaken fail maintain high level achievementofficial tournament

furthermore sumo doe provide mean achievement besidesofficial tournament aforementioned meritocracy determined
solely winning record official tournamenthand many eastern martial art competitor displayskill performing standard routine called kata form receive
recognition thus sumo wrestler specialized fightertrain win bout using good techniquemean gaining better privilege stable higher
salaries

another notable unique aspect sumo brevity bout many
fighting art fought round otherwise timed sessionwinner determined point comparison judge opinionsuperiority sumo bout often end quickly therefore require
extreme mental concentration tachiai
