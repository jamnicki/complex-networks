official apologies

japanese government considers legal moral positionregard war crime separate therefore maintainingjapan violated international law treaty japanese governments
officially recognised suffering japanese military
caused numerous apology issued japanese
government example prime minister tomiichi murayama august
stated japan colonial rule aggression
caused tremendous damage suffering people many countries
particularly asian nation expressed feelings
deep remorse stated heartfelt apology also september
japanese prime minister kakuei tanaka stated japanese
side keenly conscious responsibility serious damage
japan caused past chinese people wardeeply reproach
however official apology widely viewed inadequate many
survivor crime andor family dead victims
subject official apology controversial many people
aggrieved alleged japanese war crime maintain apologyissued particular act andor japanese governmentmerely expressed regret remorse however accordingoxford english dictionary apology formal public statementregret moreover japanese word apology also
used several occasion allege mediumcountry gloss hide effort reconciliation japan
including generous japanese aid package especially countries
medium outlet formal facto state controlalleged reflects antijapanese sentiment

japan asserted demandedjapanese prime minister andor emperor perform dogezaindividual kneel bow head grounda high formapology east asian society japan appears unwilling
point act german chancellor willy brandt kneltmonument jewish victim warsaw ghetto inasexample powerful effective act apology reconciliation
although everyone agrees

citing brandt action example john borneman associate
professor anthropology cornell state apology
represents nonmaterial purely symbolic exchange wherebywrongdoer voluntarily lower status person borneman
state type apology given injured
party must forgive seek reconciliation else apology wont
effect injured party may reject apology several
reason one prevent reconciliationkeeping memory wound alive refusal prevent affirmation
mutual humanity instrumentalizing power embeddedstatus permanent victim

therefore argue nation reluctance acceptconciliatory gesture japan made may nation
doesnt think japan lowered enough providesincere apology hand others state beliefparticular nation choosing reject reconciliation pursuitpermanent victimhood status way try assert powerjapan

compensation

widespread perception japanese government haaccepted legal responsibility compensation direct
consequence denial failed compensate individual
victim japanese atrocity particular number prominent
human right woman right organisation insist japan still
ha moral andor legal responsibility compensate individual
victim especially sex slave conscripted japanese military
occupied country known comfort women

japanese government officially accepted requirementmonetary compensation victim war crime specifiedpotsdam declaration detail compensation leftbilateral treaty individual country except north korea
japan recognises south korea sole legitimate government
korean peninsula case pow western allies
compensation paid victim red cross total
amount japan paid washowever number asian
country claim compensation either abandoned political

therefore japanese government position proper

debate japan

widespread perception outside japanreluctance inside japan discus event andor admitwar crime however controversial event japanese
imperial era openly debated medium various
political party ideological group taking quite different
position differentiates japan germany austriajapan restriction freedom speech regardmatter germany austria european
country holocaust denial criminal offence

debate considered fringe topicmedium japanese medium opinion political centreleft tends dominate editorial newspaper right
tend dominate magazine debate regarding war crime confined
largely editorial tabloid magazine calloverthrow ofimperialist america revived venerationemperor coexisted pornography commemoratenormalisation relationship china asahi shimbun major
liberal newspaper ran series japanese war crime china
including nanking massacre opened floodgate debates
continued ever since generally consideredperiod issue become truly mainstreamincident nanking massacre yasukuni shrine comfort women
accuracy school history textbook validity tokyo
trial debated even television

consensus japanese jurist japanese forcetechnically commit violation international law many right wing
element japan taken mean war crime trialexample victor justice see convicted war crimemartyr shwashwa junnanshashwa name
given rule hirohito interpretation vigorously
contested japanese peace group political left past
group tended argue trial hold validity
either geneva convention even though japan hadnt signed
undefined concept international law consensus
alternatively argued although trial maytechnically valid still somewhat linepopular opinion west rest asia however peace
group left also generally consider bombing japanese
civilian ally particularly atomic bombing hiroshima
nagasaki unjust andor violation international law
left also accused soft soviet atrocities

early century revived interest japan imperial
past brought new interpretation group halabelled new right new left group pointmany act committed japanese force including nanjing incident
generally use word massacre violationjapanese military code suggested war crime tribunals
conducted postwar japanese government strict
accordance japanese military law many accused
would still convicted executed therefore morallegal failure question fault japanese militarygovernment executing constitutionallydefined duty

new rightnew left also take view ally committedwar crime japan japan signatorygeneva convention victor ally every rightdemand form retribution japan consented various
treaties

however logic new rightnew left considerskilling chinese suspected guerilla activityperfectly legal valid including killed nanjing
example also take view many chinese civilian
casualty resulted scorched earth tactic chinese
nationalist though tactic arguably legal new rightnew
left take position civilian death causedscorched earth tactic wrongly attributed japanese
military

similarly take position attempted sue
japanese government compensation legal andor moral
case

new rightnew left also take sympathetic view korean
claim victimhood prior annexation japan korea watributary qing dynasty according japanese
colonisation though undoubtedly harsh better previous
rule term human right economic development

also argue kantgun also known kwantung army
wa least partly culpable although kantgun nominally
subordinate japanese high command time leadership
demonstrated significant selfdetermination showninvolvement plot assassinate zhang zuolin inandmanchurian incident ofwhich led foundation manchukuo
inmoreover time official policyjapanese high command confine conflict manchuriadefiance high command kantgun invaded china properpretext marco polo bridge incident however japanese
government failed court martial officer responsible
incident also accepted war chinamany involved even promotedofficer involved nanking massacre also promoted
therefore claim government held hostage soldierfield hold little weight

whether hirohito bear responsibilityfailure sticking point new right new left though
side agree constitutionally exempt legal
responsibility insist ultimately responsiblepolitically morally cite fact waremperor consulted prime minister shigeru yoshida regarding possible
abdication course action yoshida advised others
argue hirohito deliberately styled rule mannerbritish constitutional monarchy always accepted decisions
consenses reached high command accordingly moralpolitical failure rest primarily japanese high commandcabinet later convicted tokyo war crimes
