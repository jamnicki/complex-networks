uses

power generation

natural gas major source electricity generationuse gas turbine steam turbine particularly high efficiencies
achieved combining gas turbine steam turbinecombined cycle mode natural gas burn cleaner fossil fuels
oil coal produce greenhouse gas per unit energy
released equivalent amount heat burning natural gas
produce aboutless carbon dioxide burning petroleumle burning coalcombined cycle power generation using
natural gas thus cleanest source power available using fossil
fuel technology widely used wherever gas obtained
reasonable cost fuel cell technology may eventually provide
cleaner option converting natural gas electricity yet
pricecompetitive also natural gas supply saidpeak around yearyears peak oil also
projected world supply natural gas exhausted
around year 

hydrogen

compared modern diesel engine partially due factnatural gas engine function using otto cycle researchway improve processwestport cycle

liquified petroleum gas propane butane blend also usedfuel vehicle lpg cng vehicle fuel system compatible cng
also requires higher pressure tank typically much heavier
