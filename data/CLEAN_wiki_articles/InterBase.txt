interbase relational database management system rdbms currently
developed marketed borland software corporation interbasedistinguished dbms small footprint close zero
administration requirement multigenerational architecture
interbase run linux microsoft window solaris operating
systems

technology

many respect interbase quite conventionalsqlcompliant relational database support standard interfaces
jdbc odbc adonet however certain technical features
distinguish interbase products

small footprint

full interbaseserver installation requires aroundmb disk
significantly smaller client installation many
competing database server server little memoryidle minimum interbase client install requires aboutkb disk
space

minimal administration

interbase server typically require fulltime database
administrators

multigenerational architecture

concurrency control

consider simple banking application two user accessfund particular account bob read account finds
isdollars withdrawsjane readaccount bob changed seesdollars withdraws
needle say database system multiuser access needs
sort system dealing problem

technique used solve related problem known
database industry concurrency control

traditional product used lock stated particular
transaction going modify record lock placedone else could read modify data lock releasedlock may block change single record page group records
stored together disk record every record examinedparticular transaction depending lock resolution lock
resolution tradeoff performance accuracyby
blocking update page level example updateblocked fact conflict update madetransaction performance improved comparisonrecord level locks

locking becomes even bigger problem combined another
feature common system transaction isolationtransaction typically involve read writein
example read value account changeorder show isolated view data entire transaction
including record read never written must locked many
database servers

interbase reader block writer instead recorddatabase exist one version instance bobjane read account would get versionreading 
dollar bob change account make withdrawaldata overwritten instead new versionwill created
withdollars janes attempt make herdollar withdrawalnotice new versionand attempt makewithdrawal fail

approach concurrency control called multiversion concurrency
control interbases implementation multiversion concurrency control
commonly called multigenerational architecture interbasesecond commercial database use technique firstdec rdbeln

multiversion concurrency control also make true snapshot transaction
isolation relatively simple implement transaction snapshot
isolation interbase show state database preciselywa instant transaction began usefulbackup active database longrunning batch processlike

rollback recovery

interbase also multigenerational architecture implement
rollback database server use log implement rollback
feature result rollback taking long time possibly
even requiring manual intervention contrast interbases rollbacks
nearinstantaneous never fail

drawbacks

certain operation difficult implementmultigenerational architecture hence perform slowly relativetraditional implementation one example sql count verb
even index available column column includedcount record must visited order seevisible current transaction isolation
