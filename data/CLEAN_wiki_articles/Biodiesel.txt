chemically transesterified biodiesel comprises mix mono alkyl
ester long chain fatty acid common form methanolproduce methyl ester cheapest alcohol available though
ethanol used produce ethyl ester biodiesel higher
alcohol isopropanol butanol also used using
alcohol higher molecular weight improves cold flow properties
resulting ester cost efficient
transesterification reaction byproduct transesterification
