christian nubia long considered something backwater mainly
graf small lacking grave good previous
erasmodern scholar realize due cultural reasons
makurians actually rich vibrant art culture

one important discovery rushed work priorflooding lower nubia cathedral faras large building
completely filled sand preserving series magnificent

wa heavily influenced byzantine art also showed influenceegyptian coptic art palestinemainly religious nature

biblical figures

nubian pottery period also notable shinnie refersrichest indigenous pottery tradition african continent
scholar divide pottery three era early periodtoaccording adam toaccording shinnie saw
fairly simple pottery similar late roman empire also
saw much nubian pottery imported egypt rather produced
domestically adam feel trade ended invasion

number different language use makuria early
century byzantine influence still strong greek waprimary written language perhaps also language usedroyal court greek continued used later centuryceremonial purpose many gravestone later
inscription marked frequent spelling grammar errors

ancestral modern nobiin language still spoken region
