traveling proxima centauri

proxima centauri suggested logical first destinationinterstellar travel although flare star wouldparticularly hospitable current standard spaceship space
shuttle travel orbit atkms speed would take

speed journey proxima centauri would takeyears
proposed vasimr propulsion system possibly able achieve speeds
tokms would shorten journey mereyears
still firmly beyond current lifespan man machinefollows interstellar travel would require significant development
