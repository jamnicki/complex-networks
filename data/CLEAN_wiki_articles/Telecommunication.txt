key concepts

etymology
word telecommunication adapted french word
tlcommunication compound greek prefix tele 
meaning far communication meaning transfer
information

basic element telecommunication systemtransmitter take information convert signal
transmission
transmission medium signal transmitted
receiver receives convert signal back usable
information

example consider radio broadcast case broadcast
tower transmitter radio receivertransmission medium free space often telecommunication systemtwoway device act transmitter receivertransceiver example mobile phone transceiver
telecommunication phone line called pointtopoint
communication one transmitter one receiver
telecommunication radio broadcast called broadcast
communication one powerful transmitternumerous receivers

signal either analogue digital analogue signalsignal varied continuously respect informationdigital signal information encoded set discrete values
eg telecommunication device convert different types
information sound video electrical optical
signal electrical signal typically travel along mediumcopper wire carried air radio wave optical signals
typically travel along medium strand glass fibersignal reach destination device receiving end
convert signal back understandable message sound
telephone moving image television word pictures

collection transmitter receiver transceiverscommunicate known network digital network may
consist one router route data correct useranalogue network may consist one switch establishconnection two user type networkrepeater may necessary amplify recreate signaltransmitted long distance combat attenuation
render signal indistinguishable noise

channel division transmission medium used
send multiple independent stream data example radio
station may broadcast atmhz another radio station may
broadcast atmhz case medium dividedfrequency channel received separate frequency broadcast
alternatively one could allocate channel recurring segment
time broadcast

shaping signal convey information known modulation
modulation key concept telecommunication frequently
used impose information one signal another modulationused represent digital message analogue waveformknown keying several keying technique existthese include
phaseshift keying amplitudeshift keying minimumshift keying
bluetooth example phaseshift keying exchangedevice see note

however relevant earlier discussion modulation also used
boost frequency analogue signal raw
signal often suitable transmission long distancefree space due low frequency hence information mustsuperimposed higher frequency signal known carrier wave
transmission several different modulation schemes
available achieve thissome basic amplitude
modulation frequency modulation example processdj voice superimposed amhz carrier wave using frequency
modulation voice would received radio channel
