sign symptoms

symptom suggest lung cancer include
dyspnea shortness breath
hemoptysis coughing blood
chronic cough change regular coughing pattern
wheezing
chest pain pain abdomen
cachexia weight loss fatigue loss appetite
dysphonia hoarse voice
clubbing fingernail uncommon
difficulty swallowing

treatment include surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy

surgery
