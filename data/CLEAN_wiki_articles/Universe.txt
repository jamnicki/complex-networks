shape universe

important open question cosmology shape universe
mathematically manifold represents best spatial partuniverse

firstly whether universe spatially flat whether rules
euclidean geometry valid largest scale unknown
currently cosmologist believe observable universenearly spatially flat local wrinkle massive objects
distort spacetime surface lake nearly flatopinion strengthened latest data wmap lookingacoustic oscillation cosmic microwave background radiation
temperature variations

secondly whether universe multiply connected unknownuniverse spatial boundary according standard big bang
model nevertheless may spatially finitecompactunderstood using twodimensional analogy surface sphereedge nonetheless finite area twodimensional
surface constant curvature third dimension spherethreedimensional equivalent three dimensionconstantly curved fourth

universe indeed spatially finite describedtraveling straight line given direction would
theoretically cause one eventually arrive back starting
point

strictly speaking call star galaxy viewstar galaxy since possible universemultiplyconnected sufficiently small appropriate
perhaps complex shape see several time aroundvarious perhaps direction think house mirrors
actual number physically distinct star galaxies
would smaller currently accounted although possibility
ha ruled result latest cosmic microwave
background research make appear unlikely
