farming refers wide range agricultural production work coveringlarge spectrum operation scale acerage output etc practices
commercial inclination one end spectrumsubsistence farmer farm small area limited resource inputproduce enough food meet need hisher family

end spectrum commercial intensive agriculture
including industrial agriculture farming involves large fields
andor number animal large resource input pesticidefertilizer etc high level mechanization operations

modern agriculture extends well beyond traditional productionfood human animal feed agricultural production goods

th century saw massive change agricultural practice
particularly agricultural chemistry agricultural chemistry includes
application chemical fertilizer chemical insecticide see pest
control chemical fungicide soil makeup analysisagricultural product nutritional need farm animal beginning
western world green revolution spread many changes
farm throughout world varying success

recent change agriculture include hydroponics plant
breeding hybridization gene manipulation better management soil
nutrient improved weed control genetic engineering yielded
crop capability beyond naturally occurring
plant higher yield disease resistance modified seeds
germinate faster thus grown extended growing area
genetic engineering plant proven controversial particularlycase herbicideresistant plants

engineer may develop plan irrigation drainage conservationsanitary engineering particularly important normally arid areas
rely upon constant irrigation large scale farms
