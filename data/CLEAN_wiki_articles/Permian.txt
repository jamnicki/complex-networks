permiantriassic extinction event

permian ended extensive extinction event recordedpaleontology permiantriassic extinction eventtoof
marine specie became extinct well asof terrestrial
organism individual level perhaps many asof separate
organism died result event

also significant evidence massive flood basaltmagma output contributed environmental stress leading mass
extinction reduced coastal habitat highly increased aridity
probably also contributed

another hypothesis involves ocean venting hydrogen sulfide gas
portion deep ocean periodically lose dissolved
oxygen allowing bacteria live without oxygen flourishproduce hydrogen sulfide gas enough hydrogen sulfide accumulatesanoxic zone gas rise atmosphere

oxidizing gas atmosphere would destroy toxic gashydrogen sulfide would soon consume atmospheric gas
available convert hydrogen sulfide level would increase
dramatically hundred years

modeling event indicate gas would destroy ozoneupper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation kill species
survived toxic gas kump alof coursespecie metabolize hydrogen sulfide

even speculative hypothesis intense radiationnearby supernova responsible extinctions

trilobite thrived since cambrian time finally became
extinct end permian
