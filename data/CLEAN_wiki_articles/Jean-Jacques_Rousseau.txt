legacy

rousseau idea influential time french revolution
although since popular sovereignty exercisedrepresentative rather directly cannot saidrevolution sense implementation rousseau ideas
subsequently writer benjamin constant hegel soughtblame excess revolution especially reign terror
rousseau justice claim mattercontroversy

rousseau one first modern writer seriously attackinstitution private property therefore sometimes considered
forebear modern socialism communism see friedrich engelskarl marx though marx rarely mention rousseau writings
rousseau also questioned assumption majority always
correct argued goal government secure
freedom equality justice within state regardlessmajority see democracy

one primary principle rousseau political philosophypolitics morality separated state fails
act moral fashion cease function proper manner
cease exert genuine authority individual second
important principle freedom state created preserve

rousseau idea education profoundly influenced modern
educational theory mile differentiates healthyuseless crippled child healthy child rewarding
object educational work minimizes importancebooklearning recommends child emotioneducated reason placed special emphasis learningexperience john darlingsbook childcentered educationcritic argues history modern educational theoryseries footnote rousseau

character little world nature thus signifies interiorityintegrity opposed imprisonment enslavementsociety imposes name progressive emancipationcoldhearted brutality

hence back nature mean restore man forcenatural process place outside every oppressing bond society
prejudice civilization idea madethought particularly important romanticism though rousseausometimes regarded figure enlightenment
