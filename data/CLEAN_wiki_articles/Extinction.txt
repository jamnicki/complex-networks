pseudoextinction

descendant may may exist extinct specie daughter species
evolve parent specie carry parent species
genetic information even though parent specie may become
extinct daughter specie life case specieproduced new variant none able survive parent
specie extinction extinction parent specie daughter
specie subspecies still alive also called pseudoextinction

however pseudoextinction difficult demonstrate unless one hastrong chain evidence linking living specie memberpreexisting specie example sometimes claimedextinct hyracotherium ancient animal similarhorse pseudoextinct rather extinct several
extant specie horse including zebra donkey howeverfossil specie typically leave genetic material behindpossible say whether hyracotherium actually evolved modern
horse specie simply evolved common ancestor modern
horse pseudoextinction much easier demonstrate larger

genetic demographic causes

population genetics demographic phenomenon affect evolutiontherefore risk extinction specie regarding possibility
extinction small population represent entire speciemuch vulnerable type effects

natural selection act propagate beneficial genetic traiteliminate weakness however sometimes possibledeleterious mutation spread throughout populationeffect genetic drift

diverse deep gene pool give population higher chancesurviving adverse change condition effect cause reward
loss genetic diversity increase chance extinctionspecie population bottleneck dramatically reduce genetic
diversity severely limiting number reproducing individuals

habitat degradation

ability compete effectively diminished resource new
competitor species

habitat degradation toxicity kill specierapidly killing living member contaminationsterilizing also occur longer period lower
toxicity level affecting life span reproductive capacitycompetitiveness

habitat degradation also take form physical destructionniche habitat widespread destruction tropical rainforestreplacement open pastureland widely cited exampleelimination dense forest eliminated infrastructure
