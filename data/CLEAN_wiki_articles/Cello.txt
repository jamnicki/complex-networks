sound

cello produce deep rich vibrant sound cello reaches
lowest pitch traditional string quartet capablecovering nearly entire range pitch produced human
voice upper register many cello may saidtenorlike timbre lowest possible pitch tunedcgda lowest highest highest pitch without
considering harmonic fingerboard somewhere around played string zoltn kodalys solo sonata requiresspectacular played concluding measures

playing technique

body position

cello played sitting knee apart instrument
scroll top instrument placedplayer left ear making string closest earstring furthest ear shoulder squarerelaxed arm loose able move freely

early time cello played woman positioned
alongside leg considered improper lady partknee public

left hand technique

left hand determines pitch note celloplayed hand positioned either thumb back
neck four finger available depressstring fingerboard five fingerfingerboard side thumb used well tipfinger known thumb position finger normally
held curved knuckle bent unless certain interval require
flat finger fifth fast playing finger contactstring tip almost nail slower expressive
playing flat fingerpad used allowing richer tonefuller vibrato string depressed string
closer bridge resulting pitch higherstring shortened depressed string
closer scroll instrument pitch lower

additional left hand techniques

vibrato

vibrato consists oscillating finger left handplaying note result pitch note waver
slightly much singer voice sustained note well
developed vibrato technique key expressive device essential
element accomplished cello player style musicromantic period vibrato used almost every note
however style baroque piece vibrato used
used rarely ornament typically lower pitchnote played wider vibrato used lefthand stayplace bottom fingerboard finger holding
string wiggle doe movestring

glissandi

glissando note played sliding fingerfingerboard without releasing string cause pitch rise
fall smoothly without separate discernable steps

harmonics

harmonic produced lightly touching fully depressing
string finger certain place bowing even
plucking string example halfway point stringproduce harmonic one octave unfingered open
string effect doubling frequency open stringalso artificial harmonic player depresses string
one finger touching string lightly another
finger certain interval mostly perfect fourth highertechnique produce distinctive sound effect resembling flute
artificial harmonic performed routinely thumb pressed
fully third finger lightly touching string fourth
higher

right hand technique

cello playing bow much like breath wind instrument
player arguably major determinant expressivenessplaying right hand hold bow control durationcharacter note bow drawn along stringarea fingerboard bridge direction perpendicular
string bow held five finger right
hand thumb opposite finger closer cellist body
shape hand resemble relaxed statefinger curved including thumb transmission powerarm bow happens pronation inward rotationunderarm thus pushing index finger lesser degreemiddle finger onto bow necessary counterforce providedthumb little finger control angle stringbalance bow lifted string see spiccatoshoulder remains relaxed well arm downbow bow
drawn right player moving hand first usingupper arm forearm wrist turning slightly inward
order maintain straight stroke upbow bowdrawn left way moving first forearm upper arm
wrist pushing slightly upward bow always held
perpendicular string played order perform string
change whole arm either lowered lifted little wrist
movement possible order maintain angle string
however certain flexibility wrist necessary changing
bow direction upbow downbow vice versa fast
bow movement wrist used accomplish horizontal movement
bow longer stroke arm used well wrist

tone production volume sound depend combination several
factor three important one bow speed pressure applied
string point contact bow hair stringgood player capable even tone counternatural tendency play force part bow
nearest frog heel least force near tipcloser bridge string bowed louder brightertone extreme sul ponticello producing metallic shimmery
sound bowing closer fingerboard sul tasto sound
produced softer mellow defined

additional right hand techniques

double stops

double stop involve playing two note time two
string fingered simultaneously bow drawnsound triple quadruple stop may also played
broken fashion difficult sustain

pizzicato

pizzicato playing string plucked right hand
finger rarely left hand bow simply
held away string rest hand even setsingle string played pizzicato double triple quadruple
stop played occasionally player must bow one stringright hand simultaneously pluck another leftmarked aabove note strumming chord also possible
guitar fashion

col legno

col legno technique player tap wooden stickbow string give percussive sound quite
often used contemporary music famous example openingmar gustav holsts planet suite entire string
section orchestra play col legno

spiccato

spiccato bouncy bow playing string drawnbow struck still retaining horizontal motion
form percussive crisp sound may performed using
wrist dip bow string spiccato usually
associated lively playing violin spiccato bowing comestring cello wood bow may rise brisklywithout hair actually leaving string

staccato

staccato player move bow short distanceapplies greater pressure create forced sound

tuning range

cello four string referred standard tuningperfect fifth interval astring highest sounding
dstring gstring cstring lowest sounding astringtuned pitch three semitone lower middle dstring fifth lower gstring fifthg cstring tuned two octave lower middle piece notably bachssuites unaccompanied
cello require altered tuning string known scordatura
another wellknown example zoltn kodlys solo cello sonata many
believe bachssuites unaccompanied celloactually written five string violoncello piccolo smaller
cello high estring astring longer
commonly used unlike five string violin viola bass five
string acoustic cello difficult find however many electric
cello model five even six strings

lower range cello limited tuninglowest string typically two octave middle althoughmany piece must adjusted hit occasional low noteupper range cello varies according skill player
length fingerboard general guideline writingprofessional cellist set upper limit two octavemiddle although even higher pitch possible one extra
octave enormous range instrument written music
cello frequently alternate bass clef tenor clef
treble clef romantic composer notably dvok also wrote
note treble clef intended played octave lower
written technique common century
