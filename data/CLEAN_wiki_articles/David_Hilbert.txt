finiteness theorem

hilbert first work invariant function leddemonstration inof famous finiteness theorem twenty years
earlier paul gordan demonstrated theorem finitenessgenerator binary form using complex computational approachattempt generalize method function two
variable failed enormous difficulty calculations
involved hilbert realized necessary take completely
different path result demonstrated hilbert basis theorem
showing existence finite set generator invariants
quantic number variable abstract formdemonstrating existence set waalgorithmic existence theorem

hilbert sent result mathematische annalen gordanhouse expert theory invariant mathematische annalen
wa able appreciate revolutionary nature hilberts
theorem rejected article criticizing expositionwa insufficiently comprehensive comment
theology mathematics

klein hand recognized importance workguaranteed would published without alterations
encouraged klein comment gordan hilbert second
article extended method providing estimation maximum
degree minimum set generator sentannalen read manuscript klein wrotesaying

without doubt important work general algebra
annalen ever published

later usefulness hilbert method universally
recognized gordan would say

must admit even theology merits

axiomatization geometry

see supplement hilbert axioms

text grundlagen der geometrie foundation geometry
published hilbert insubstitutes formal set comprised 
axiom traditional axiom euclid avoid weaknesses
identified euclid whose work time still used
textbookfashion independently contemporaneously yearold
american student named robert lee moore published equivalent setaxiom axiom coincide axiommoore system theorem hilbert viceversa

hilbert approach signalled shift modern axiomatic method
axiom taken selfevident truth geometry may treat things
powerful intuition necessaryassign explicit meaning undefined concept elements
point line plane others could substitutedhilbert say table chair glass beerobject defined relationship discussed

hilbert first enumerates undefined concept point line plane
lying relation point plane betweenness
congruence pair point congruence angle axioms
unify plane geometry solid geometry euclid single
system

ironically day hilbert pronounced phrase kurt gdel
presented thesis containing famous incompleteness theorem
