key boxwood clarinet 

clarinet developed baroque instrument called chalumeau
instrument similar recorder single reed
mouthpiece similar modern clarinet cylindrical
bore lacking register key played fundamental
register limited range one half octaveeight finger hole like recorder plus two key extra notes

around end century chalumeau modifiedconverting one key register key produced first
clarinet development attributed german instrument maker
named johann christoph denner instrument played wellmiddle register loud strident tone given name
clarinetto meaning little trumpet clarinoetto early
clarinet play well lower register chalumeaux
continued made play low note note became known
chalumeau register clarinet improved chalumeau fell
disuse

get extra note classical clarinet mozart day would
probably eight finger hole five keys

clarinet soon accepted orchestra later modelmellower tone original mozart dliked soundclarinet considered tone closest qualityhuman voice wrote much music time beethoven

final development modern design clarinet usedworld today introduced hyacinthe klos inhe
devised different arrangement key finger hole allow
simpler fingering inspired boehm system developedtheobald boehm flute maker invented system flutes

however became standard today boehm system used
everywhere world except germany austria countries
still use direct descendant mueller clarinet knownoehler system clarinet also contemporary dixieland klezmer
player continue use albert system clarinet simpler
fingering system allow easier slurring note one time
