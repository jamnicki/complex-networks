occurrence

selenium occurs naturally number inorganic form selenide
selenate selenite soil selenium often occurs soluble
form like selenate analogous sulfate leachedriver easily runoff

selenium biology also occurs organic compound dimethyl
selenide selenomethionine selenocysteine compounds
selenium play analogous role sulfur

selenium commonly produced selenide many sulfide ores
copper silver lead obtained byproduct
processing ore anode mud copper
refinery mud lead chamber sulfuric acid plants
