chronology

since apart high german consonant shift took place
beginning writing old high german century
dating various phase uncertain businessestimate quoted mostly taken dtvatlas zur deutschen
sprache different estimate appear elsewhere example
waterman asserts first three phase occurred fairly close
together complete alemannic territory bytaking
another two three century spread north

sometimes historical constellation help example factattila called etzel german prof second phase mustproductive hunnish invasion century fact
many latin loanword shifted german latin
stratagerman strae others latin poenagerman
pein allows date sound change likely
period borrowing however useful source chronological
data german word cited latin text late classicalearly mediaeval period

precise dating would case difficult since shift maybegun one word group word speech one locality
gradually extended lexical diffusion wordphonological pattern longer period time spreadwider geographical areas

however relative chronology phasesandcan easilyestablished observation ttz must precede dtturn must precede otherwise word originalcouldundergone three shift ended phenomenonearly phase sound shift leaf gap case voiceless
stop later phase fill mean chain shiftfamiliar enough grimm law proceeds similar sequence

alternative chronology proposed according widely
accepted theory german linguist theo vennemann consonant

east germanic hypotheses

consonant shift resulting second third phases
appear also observable lombardic early mediaeval germanic
language northern italy preserved runic fragmentlate early century unfortunately lombardic
record sufficient allow complete taxonomylanguage therefore uncertain whether language experienced
full shift merely sporadic reflex clearly
attested may mean shift began italyspread southward well northward ernst schwarz otherssuggested shift occurred german result contacts
lombardic fact relationship evidence
lombardic would force conclude third phase mustbegun late century rather earlier estimatewould necessarily require spread germanearly however lombardic east germanic language part
german language dialect continuum equally possibleparallel shift took place independently

similarly waterman show change analogous fourth phase
high german consonant shift may taken place gothic also
east germanic early third century suggestsmay spread gothic high german resultvisigothic migration westward cad like lombardic
hypothesis interesting possibility present stateknowledge doe allow firm conclusions
