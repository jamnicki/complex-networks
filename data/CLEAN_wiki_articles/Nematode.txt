morphology

nematode triploblastic protostomes complete digestive
system roundworm circulatory respiratory systemuse diffusion breathe circulation substance aroundbody thin round cross section thoughactually bilaterally symmetric nematode one simplest
animal group complete digestive system separate

past anus cloaca called tail epidermis secreteslayered cuticle made keratin protects body dryingdigestive juice harsh environment wellform sporting projection cilium aid locomotion
although cuticle allows movement shape change viahydrostatic skeletal system inelastic doe allowvolume worm increase therefore worm grows hamoult form new cuticle cuticle dont allow volumeincrease keep hydrostatic pressure inside organismhigh reason roundworm posse circular muscles
longitudinal one theyre required hydrostatic
pressure reason roundworm round

freeliving nematode microscopic though parasitic
form grow several meter length typically parasitelarge animal whale circular musclebody undulate side side contact solid
object necessary locomotion thrashing motion varymostly completely ineffective swimming

nematode generally eat bacteria fungi protozoan althoughfilter feeder excretion separate excretory pore

reproduction usually sexual male usually smaller females
often much smaller often characteristically bent tail
holding female copulation copulation onechitinized spicule move cloaca insertedgenital pore female amoeboid sperm crawl along spiculefemale worm

egg may embryonated unembryonated passed female
meaning fertilized egg may yet developedfreeliving roundworm egg hatch larva eventually

complicated

nematode simple nervous system main nerve cord running
along ventral side sensory structure anterior endcalled amphids sensory structure posterior endcalled phasmids

parasitic species

parasitic form often quite complicated life cycle moving
several different host location host body
infection occurs variously eating uncooked meat larvaentrance unprotected cut directly skintransfer via bloodsucking insect forth

nematode commonly parasitic human include whipworms hookworms
pinworm ascarids filarids specie trichinella spiralis
commonly known trichina worm occurs rat pig humans
responsible disease trichinosis baylisascaris usually
infests wild animal deadly human well haemonchus
contortus one abundant infectious agent sheep around
