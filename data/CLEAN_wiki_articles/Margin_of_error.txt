margin error population size

interesting mathematical fact margin error depends
sample size population size providedpopulation significantly larger sample sizeprovided simple random sample used thus instance pollrunning example withrandomly sampled registered voter would
yield essentially margin errorwith alevelconfidence regardless whether population registered voters
consisted ofpeople orpeople

may seem counterintuitive first personpopulation unique personality opinion large
population small fraction people would actuallypolled would thus seem poll capturing enough
information however poll involves specific
question one relevant attribute populationneed considered mean individual opinioneffectively equivalent many memberpopulation fraction polled instancerunning example relevant attribute population memberwhether bush voter kerry voter nader voter 
characteristic population member irrelevant thus
instance areregistered voter 
kerry voter purpose statistical
analysis theindividuals group wouldcompletely interchangeable equivalent individual kerry voter
hasother voter identical opinion far poll
question concerned exceedingly likely pollvoter contain properly representative fractiongroup provided course voter polled selected
randomly

doe choose kerry choose bush vice versa ieperfectly negatively correlated assumption may tenable
