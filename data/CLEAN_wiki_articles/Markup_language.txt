class markup languages

markup language often divided three class presentational
procedural descriptive

presentational markup

presentational markup attempt infer document structurecue encoding example text file titledocument might preceded several newlines andor space thus
suggesting leading spacing centering wordprocessing desktop
publishing product sometimes attempt deduce structureconvention enormous variety wiki plaintext
convention prove yet unresolved problem

procedural markup

procedural markup typically also focused presentationtext usually visible user editing text fileexpected interpreted software orderappears format title succession formatting directive would
inserted file immediately title text
instructing software switch centered display mode enlarge
embolden typeface title text would followeddirective reverse effect advanced system macrostack model make tedious case procedural
markup capability comprise turingcomplete programming language
example proceduralmarkup system include nroff troff tex lout
postscript procedural markup widely used professional
publishing application professional typographerexpected learn language required

descriptive markup

descriptive markup semantic markup applies label fragmenttext without necessarily mandating particular displayprocessing semantics example atom syndication language
provides markup label updated timestampassertion publisher item informationlast changed atom specification discus meaningupdated timestamp specifies markup used identifymake assertion whether might presenteduser software might put markup variety including
many foreseen designer atom language sgml xml
system explicitly designed support design descriptive
markup languages

practice class markup usually cooccur given
system example html contains markup element purely
procedural example bold others purely
descriptive blockquote href attribute html also
includes pre element encloses area presentational markup
laid exactly typed

set markup element rule use commonly developed
standard body support kind document usedparticular industry community one earliestcals used military technical manual industrylargescale documentation requirement soon followed suit developing
tagsets aircraft telecommunication automotive computer
hardware manual led delivering many manual solelyelectronic form company able produce printed online
cdbased manual single descriptive markup sourcenotable example sun microsystems jon bosak later
founded xml committee decided sgml multitarget
documentation delivery achieving considerable cost savings

markup language abound among widely known docbook
mathml svg open ebook tei xbrl many various kindtext document specialized language used manydomains

generic markup another term descriptive markup modern
descriptive markup system structure document tree also
providing mean embedding crossreferencesdocument readily treated database database
system aware structure notblobs paststrict schema relational database however
commonly calledsemistructured databases

third millennium great interest arisen document
structure tree example ancient sacred
literature commonly rhetorical prose structure stories
pericopes paragraph well reference structure
book chapter verse line since boundary units
often cross cannot readily encoded using treestructured

primary virtue descriptive markup consideredflexibility fragment text labeledopposed displayed software may written
process fragment useful way anticipateddesigner language example html hyperlink originally
designed activation human following link also widely
used web search engine discovering new material index
estimating popularity web resources

descriptive markup also facilitates simpler task reformattingdocument needed format specification intertwined
content example italic might used emphasis
indicate foreign word however merely tagged
presentationally procedurally italic ambiguity cannot
readily sorted decision later made italicize
foreign word nothing review italic
portion sort one one however two casedescriptively generically tagged differently begin either
reformatted without interfering
history

term markup derived traditional publishing practice
marking manuscript adding symbolic printers
instruction margin paper manuscript centurytask done specialist known markup men proofreadermarked text indicate typeface style sizeapplied part handed manuscript someone
else tedious task typesetting hand familiar examplemanual markup symbol still use proofreader marksubset larger vocabulary handwritten markup symbols

gencode

idea markup language apparently first presentedpublishing executive william tunnicliffe conference 
although preferred call generic coding tunnicliffe would
later lead development standard called gencodepublishing industry book designer stanley fish also published
speculation along similar line late brian reiddissertation carnegie mellon university developed theory
working implementation descriptive markup actual use
however ibm researcher charles goldfarb commonly seen todayfather markup language work ibm gmlchair international organization standardization
committee developed sgml first widely used descriptive markup
system goldfarb hit upon basic idea working early
project help newspaper computerize workflow althoughpublished record doe clarify later became familiarwork tunnicliffe fish heard early talk reidsparked interest

must noted detail early history descriptive
markup language hotly debated however clearnotion independently discovered several time throughoutpossibly late became important practicelate
early example markup language available outsidepublishing industry found typesetting tool unix systems
troff nroff system formatting commandinserted document text typesetting software could
format text according editor specification watrial error iterative process get document printed correctly
availability wysiwyg see get publishing
software supplanted much use language among casual users
though serious publishing work still markup specifynonvisual structure texts

tex

another major publishing standard tex created continuously
refined donald knuth tex concentrateddetailed layout text font description order typeset
mathematical book professional quality required knuthspend considerable time investigating art typesetting however
tex requires considerable skill user mainly
used academia defacto standard many scientific
discipline tex macro package known latex provides descriptive
markup system top tex widely used

sgml

first language make clear clean distinctionstructure presentation certainly scribe developed brian
reid described doctoral thesis inscriberevolutionary number way least introducedidea style separated marked document grammar
controlling usage descriptive element scribe influenceddevelopment generalized markup language later sgml direct
ancestor html latex

early idea markup focusedstructural aspect document leave visual presentationstructure interpreter led creation sgmllanguage developed committee chaired goldfarbincorporated idea many different source including tunnicliffes
project gencode sharon adler anders berglund james mason
also key member sgml committee

sgml specified syntax including markup document well
one separately describing tag alloweddocument type definitiondtd schema allowed authorcreate use markup wished selecting tag madesense named natural language thus
sgml properly metalanguage many particular markup languages
derived late substantial new markup
language based sgml system including example teidocbook sgml promulgated international standardinternational organization standardization isoin 

sgml found wide acceptance use field largescale
documentation requirement however generally foundcumbersome difficult learn side effect attemptingmuch flexible example sgml made end tagstarttags even optional certain contextthought markup would done manually overworked support staff
would appreciate saving keystrokes

html

byit appeared many sgml would limited commercial
databased application wysiwyg tool stored documents
proprietary binary format would suffice document
processing applications

situation changed sir tim bernerslee learning sgmlcoworker anders berglund others cern used sgml syntaxcreate html html resembles sgmlbased tag language althoughbegan simpler formal dtd developedlater derose argues html use descriptive markup sgmlparticular major factor success webflexibility extensibility enabled factors
include notion url free distribution browser html
quite likely used markup language world today

however html status markup language disputedcomputer scientist argument html restrictsplacement tag requiring either fully nested insidetag root tag documentscientist would suggest instead html container language
following hierarchical model

xml

another newer markup language widely used xml
extensible markup language xml developed world wide web
consortium committee created chaired jon bosak main
purpose xml simplify sgml focusing particular problem
document internet xml remains metalanguage like sgml
allowing user create tag needed hence extensibledescribing tag permitted uses

xml adoption helped every xml document also sgml
document existing sgml user software could switch xml
fairly easily however xml eliminated many complex
feature sgml easing learning implementation increasing
markup size reducing readability improvement rectified
sgml problem international setting made possibleparse interpret document hierarchy even schema available

xml designed primarily semistructured environmentdocument publication however appeared hit sweet spot
simplicity flexibility rapidly adopted many
us xml widely used communicating dataapplications

xhtml

since januaryall recommendation html basedxml rather sgml using abbrebiation xhtml extensible
hypertext markup language language specification requiresxhtml web document must wellformed xml documentsthis allows
rigorous robust document using tag familiarhtml

one noticeable difference html xhtmlrule tag must closed empty html tag must
either closed regular endtag replaced special
form brnote must space theon end
tag otherwise tag valid sgml anotherattribute value tag must quoted

xmlbased applications

many xmlbased application exist including rdf xforms docbook
soap web ontology language owl partial listsee list xml markup languages

features

common feature many markup language intermixtext document markup instruction data streamfile example small section text marked html
h anatidae p

p

code enclosed anglebrackets like markup
instruction known tag text instructions

purpose meaning text include specifically means
firstlevel heading mean paragraphem mean emphasized word device readingstructural markup may apply rule style presentingusing larger type boldface indentation whatever style prefers
instruction example presentational markupspecifies exact appearance text case useitalic typeface without specifying reason appearance

text encoding initiative tei published extensive guidelines
encode text interest humanity social
science developed year international cooperative work
guideline used countless project encoding historical
document work particular scholar period genre
alternative usage

idea markup language originated text documentincreasing usage markup language area like vector
graphic web service content syndication user interfacexml application clean wellformatted
extensible language use xml also led possibility
