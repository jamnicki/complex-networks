potassium iodide white crystalline salt chemical formula used photography radiation treatment find widespread
application iodide source hygroscopicsodium iodide making easier work turn yellow upon
heating air upon standing moist air long periodoxidation iodide iodine

chemical properties

potassium iodide behaves simple ionic salt sinceiodide ion mild reducing agent easily oxidisedpowerful oxidising agent chlorine

ki aqclaqkcliaq

even air oxidize iodide evidenced observationpurple extract rinsed dichloromethane acidic
condition oxidised even easily due formationhydroiodic acid powerful reducing agent

ki form combined elemental iodine

kiaqi skiaq

unlike salt highly watersolublevirtually identical redox potentialsandv nhe
respectively mild oxidant relative therefore reaction allows iodine used aqueous
solution redox titrations
