takeover

united state formally took control french property relating

making sense task

american bought canal essentially running operation
indeed first step taken place canal workers
employ new administration however wahelpful project may seemed operation wapoint maintained essentially minimum strength order
comply canal concession keep plant working
order

american therefore inherited small workforce also great
jumble building infrastructure equipment muchvictim fifteen year neglect harsh humid jungle
environment virtually facility place large

floating equipment put good use american throughout
construction effort

dealing disease

one greatest challenge facing builder panama canal
wa dealing tropical disease rife area particularly
yellow fever malaria eventual success project owed
substantially sanitation program put place william gorgas included general health care provisionextensive health infrastructure

significant part work intensive effort eradicate
mosquito carrier malaria yellow fever canal
zone accomplished removing possible sourcestanding water mosquito breed including drainingfilling large area swamp oiling remaining pool standing
water

effort great success contributed significantlyoverall success canal project hospital maintainedreputed best anywhere tropic somepatients
treated per year byyellow fever virtually wipedcanal zone number death caused top
disease malaria also reduced significantly

living conditions

canal zone originally minimal facility entertainment
relaxation canal worker except saloon result
men drank heavily largely nothing elsedrunkenness great problem generally unfriendly conditions
resulted many american worker returning home year
