increasingly facing competition quarter although
remote speculation continues possible new canal mexico

port two coasts

critic also voiced concern planned increasecanal toll suggesting suez canal may become viable
alternative cargo route asia east coast
nevertheless demand panama canal continues rise

increasing rate melting ice arctic ocean ledspeculation northwest passage may become viable commercial
shipping point future route would save
kilometresmi route asia europe compared
panama canal possibly leading diversion traffic
route however route would still hold significant
problem due ice well unresolved territorial issues

water issues
