plant cell structure

plant cell quite different cell eukaryotic
kingdom organism distinctive featurelarge central vacuole enclosed membrane tonoplast
maintains cell turgor control movementmolecule cytosol sap
cell wall made cellulose protein many cases
lignin deposited protoplast outside cell
membrane contrast cell wall fungimade chitin prokaryote made peptidoglycan
plasmodesmata linking pore cell wall allowplant cell communicate adjacent celldifferent network hypha used fungi
plastid especially chloroplast contain chlorophyllpigment give plant green colour allowsperform photosynthesis
plant lack centriole present animal cells

like eukaryotic cell plant cell typically also nucleus
containing cell dna mitochondrion power plants
cell however part living plant tissueselectively dead serve plant without consuming vital
nutrients

tissue types

three major class cell differentiate formtissue structure root stem leaf plant types
tissue similar location within specieplant however amount tissue vary different
plant species

three distinct type plant cell classified accordingstructure cell wall feature protoplast plants
