eating variety food contain potassium best way get
adequate amount healthy individual eat balanced diet rarely
need supplement food high source potassium include orange
juice potato banana avocado apricot parsnip turnips
although many fruit vegetable meat contain potassium
research indicated diet high potassium reduce risk
hypertension
