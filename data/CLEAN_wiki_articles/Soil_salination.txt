occurs groundwater saline true many areas
favored land use practice allowing rainwater enter
aquifer could accommodate example clearingtree agriculture major reason drylands areas
since deep rooting tree replaced shallow rootingannual crops

salinity irrigation occur time wherever irrigation
occurs since almost water natural rainfall contains
dissolved salt plant use water salt left
behind soil eventually begin accumulate since soil
salinity make difficult plant absorb soil moisture
salt must leached plant root zone applying
additional water turn lead rising water tables
requiring drainage keep saline groundwater root zone
