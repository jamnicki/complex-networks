climate change factors

climate change reflect variation within earth environment
natural process going around impact human activity
external factor shape climate often called climate
forcings include process variation solar radiation
earth orbit greenhouse gas concentrations

variation within earth climate

land use

prior widespread fossil fuel use humanity largest impact local
climate likely resulted land use irrigation
deforestation agriculture fundamentally change environment

controversial hypothesis william ruddiman suggests rise
agriculture accompanying deforestation led increases

interplay factors

certain forcing example solar variation act changeclimate may mechanism act amplify reduce
effect called positive negative feedback far
known climate system generally stable respectfeedback positive feedback run away partreason existence powerful negative feedback
temperature emitted radiation radiation increasefourth power absolute temperature

however number important positive feedback exist glacial
interglacial cycle present ice age provide important
example believed orbital variation provide timinggrowth retreat ice sheet however ice sheets
reflect sunlight back space hence promote cooling
growth known icealbedo feedbackfalling sea level expanding ice decrease plant growthindirectly lead decline carbon dioxide methane leads
cooling

similarly rising temperature caused example anthropogenic
emission greenhouse gas could lead retreating snow lines
revealing darker ground underneath consequently resultabsorption sunlight

water vapor methane carbon dioxide also act significant
positive feedback level rising response warming trend
thereby accelerating trend water vapor act strictlyfeedback excepting small amount stratosphere unlikemajor greenhouse gas also act forcings

complex feedback involve possibility changing circulation
pattern ocean atmosphere example significant concern
modern case melting glacial ice greenlandinterfere sinking water north atlantic inhibit
thermohaline circulation could affect gulf streamdistribution heat europe east coast united states

potential feedback well understood may either
inhibit promote warming example unclear whether rising
temperature promote inhibit vegetative growth could turn
draw either carbon dioxide similarly increasing
temperature may lead either cloud cover sincebalance cloud cover strong cooling effect changeabundance cloud also impact climate
