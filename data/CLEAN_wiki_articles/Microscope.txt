optical microscope use visible wavelength light
simplest hence widely used type microscope recent
research shown see brian ford research simple microscopes
even simple microscope single small lens gave
amazingly clear image earliest microscopist today compound
microscope especially series lens serve uses
many field science particularly biology geology

optical microscope use refractive lens typically glassoccasionally plastic focus light eye another light
detector typical magnification light microscope theoretical resolution aroundmicrometres specialised
technique scanning confocal microscopy may exceedmagnification resolution insurmountable diffraction
limit

microscope use electromagnetic wavelength visiblehuman eye often called optical microscope commondue high resolution yet requirement vacuum like

electron microscope

electron microscope use beam electron instead light
designed high magnification usage electronmuch smaller wavelength visible light allow much higher
resolution main limitation electron beam must
pas vacuum air molecule would otherwise scatterbeam

instead relying refraction lens electron microscopespecially designed electromagnet generates magnetic fieldapproximately parallel direction electron travelelectron typically detected phosphor screen photographic
film ccd

two major variant electron microscope exist
scanning electron microscope look surface bulk objects
scanning surface fine electron beam measuring
reflection may also used spectroscopy
transmission electron microscope pass electron completely
sample analogous basic optical microscopyrequires careful sample preparation since electron scattered
