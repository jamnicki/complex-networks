raw oil unprocessed crude oil useful formcome ground although light sweet low viscosity low
sulfur oil used directly burner fuel steam vessel

product using complex energy intensive processes

oil used many various way contains
hydrocarbon varying molecular mass form lengthparaffin aromatics naphthenes cycloalkanes alkene dienes
alkyne hydrocarbon molecule varying lengthcomplexity made hydrogen carbon atom various
structure give differing property thereby ustrick oil refinement process separating purifying

alkylation commonly dimerization octane gradegasoline also improved catalytic reforming strips
hydrogen hydrocarbon produce aromatics much
