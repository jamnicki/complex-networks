officially authority rested upon republican title however
irregular might therefore consideredrepublican official least pretended one several
senator among many former enemy graciously
pardoned grew fearful would crown tryestablish monarchy accordingly conspired assassinateides march onmarchbc lifelong dictator
perished blade assassins

octavian grandnephew adopted son political heir learned
mistake predecessor never claimed widely feared
title dictator disguising power republican form muchcarefully intended foster illusionrestoration republic received several title like
