wireless networking

ieee support provided using wifi extended range
chipset jepsen said wireless chipset run low
bitratembits maximum rather usual higher speed mbits
mbit minimize power consumption

whenever laptop powered participate mobile
adhoc network node operating peertopeer fashionlaptop hear forwarding packet across cloudcomputer cloud access internet either directlyindirectly computer cloud able accessnet data rate across network high similar
network like store forward motoman project supported
email service toschoolchildren cambodia accordingnegroponte data rate sufficient asynchronous network
application email communicate outside cloud ratherinteractive like web browsing highbandwidth applications
video streaming interactive network communicationpossible inside cloud

conventional ieee system handle traffic withinlocal cloud wireless device manner similar ethernet
network node transmits receives data doeroute packet two node cannot communicate directlyolpc laptop use ieee form wireless mesh network

country would benefit much use laptopchild undeveloped country fact state eg maine georgia providing commercial laptop pupilolpc faq responds question laptop available
relatively developed nation stating exploringpossibility developing commercial versiondiscussion representative nation distribution
noncommercial version however priority makelaptop available first greatest needcommonwealth massachusetts one initial participantolpc

people criticizing idea selling open
market one concern possibility arbitrage bmade available certain area certain party parallel
black market laptop may develop arbitrageur could findway obtain laptop going rate resellblack market higher price presence black market could
also encourage intended owner sell laptop nicholas
negroponte addressed concern presentationemerging technology conference september 


childrens machine

grey market serious issue dont want dismissive
moment three way addressing way
number one market mean cant sell
could buy isnt bullet proof thats little bit
dreaming part equation second puttechnology device help stop laptops
distributed middle schoolers maine apple ibooksgreat stuff steal dont necessarily corruption
kind pretty transferable technology theyve put
little thing machine disables hasnt
connected school put gps put sorts
stuff third one like make
machine distinctive socially stigma carrying
one child teacher obviously takebasement hope spouse even say god
honey stole church like red
cross something hoping distinctivenessproduct third one maybe isnt thought often
three combined hope least limit one percent
two percent going going

childrens machine
