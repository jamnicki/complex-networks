spiritual versus earthly rewards

older scholarship issue asserts bulkparticipant likely younger son noble dispossessed
land influenced practise primogeniture poorer
knight looking new life wealthy east

however current research suggests although urban promised
crusader spiritual well material benefit primary aimcrusader spiritual rather material gain moreover
recent research jonathan rileysmith instead show crusade
wa immensely expensive undertaking affordableknight already fairly wealthy hugh vermandoisrobert curthose relative french english royal
family raymond toulouse ruled much southern france
even wealthy knight sell much landrelative church could afford participaterelative often impoverish order raise
money crusade rileysmith say reallyevidence support proposition crusade opportunity
spare son make scarce order relievefamily burden first crusade idea crusading 

example spiritual earthly motivation godfrey bouillon
brother baldwin settled previous quarrel churchbequeathing land local clergy charter denotingtransaction written clergyman knightseem idealize knight pious men seeking fulfill vow
pilgrimage

poorer knight minores opposed greater knights
principe could crusade expected survivealmsgiving could enter service wealthier
knight case tancred agreed serve uncle
bohemund later crusade would organized wealthy kingemperor would supported special crusade taxes
