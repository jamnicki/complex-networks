controversy

like american filmmaker griffith birth nation triumph
ha criticized use spectacular filmmakingpromote system many modern time seen evil
unjust germany movie classified national socialist
propaganda showing restricted postwar denazification
law may shown educational context defense
riefenstahl claimed nave nazi madeknowledge hitler genocidal policy also pointed
triumph contains one single antisemitic word although
doe contain veiled comment julius streicher people
doe protect racial purity perish however roger
ebert observed absence antisemitismtriumph look like calculation excluding central
motif almost hitler public speech mustdeliberate decision make film efficient propaganda

riefenstahl also repeatedly defended chargewa nazi propagandist saying triumph focus imageidea therefore viewed gesamtkunstwerk total work
art inshe returned topic saying

see film today ascertain doesnt
contain single reconstructed scene everything true
contains tendentious commentary history
pure historical film filmvrit reflects truth
wa inhistory therefore documentary
propaganda film know well propagandaconsists recreating event order illustratethesis face certain event let one thing order accentuate another found heart
event reality certain timecertain place film composed stemmed
however riefenstahl active participant rally thoughlater year downplayed influence significantly claimingobserved tried film well idea helped plan
downright absurd film critic roy frumkes called triumph
antithesis objective work suggestedspecial accommodation riefenstahl received one scene featured aerial
searchlight requisitioned luftwaffe film
wa altered practically every inthecamera laboratory special
effect known film labeled anything exceptdocumentary ebert also disagrees saying triumph general
consent one best documentary ever made addedreflects ideology movement regarded manyevil pose classic question contest artmorality thing pure art doe art makepolitical statement

susan sontag considered triumph best made documentary
time brian winstons essay film movie history
vision twentieth century anthology edited david
ellwood published international association mediumhistory largely critique sontag analysis finds
faulty ultimate point filmmaker could madefilm look impressive nazi mise scne impressive
particularly offering camera restagingsform film alternate repetitively march speeches
winston asks viewer consider film seenanything pedestrian effort like rotha find film
tedious belief anyone take time analyzestructure quickly agree

wehrmacht objections

first controversy triumph occurred even release
several general wehrmacht protested minimal army
presence film one scene review german cavalry
actually involved german military formation party
organization part military hitler proposedartistic compromise triumph would open camera slowly
tracking row overlooked general placategeneral ego according testimony riefenstahl refusedsuggestion insisted keeping artistic control triumphagree return therally make film
exclusively wehrmacht became tag der freiheit

replay portion film enduring dangerous
illusion nazi germany superorganized statealthough evil nature impressive nonetheless gavin believes

movement nicholas reef concurs adding manyenduring image third reich adolf hitler deriveriefenstahls film

triumph also studied many contemporary artists
