wa provision massachusetts state lawchartering railroad prior toall railroad chartered
special act legislature made slow inefficientcharter railroad politician agree issue
would become partisan also meant legislature wouldlet boston associate build line unless could showcompletely necessary

case canal investor seemed reasonable compellingtime though aspect humorous hindsight argumentmainly
investor spent lot money canal
canal currently deal freight bostonlowell
finite amount freight moved
railroad built main purpose transporting
freight boston lowell
railroad take business away canal
ruin canal
railroad built forced pay
compensation canal investors
failure court force compensation would decrease investor
confidence make much likely people wouldwilling invest major project future

boston associate convinced legislaturecanal inherently incapable providing needed
reliable year round freight transport

canal operator also unable foresee future worthcanal state legislature massachusetts canal
spokesperson testified believed safer cheaper
mode conveyance ever established well adaptedbulky article canal doe really reflect negatively
wa common attitude time todayironic amusing

boston associate got charter junewithprovision reparation canal investor favorable
