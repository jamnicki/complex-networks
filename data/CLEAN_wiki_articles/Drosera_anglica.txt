anglica growing quaking bog wallowa mountain oregon

anglica grows open nonforested habitat wet often
calciumrich soil include bog marl fen quaking bog cobble
shore calcareous habitat tolerance calciumrelatively rare rest genus anglica often
associated various sphagnum moss many time grows soil
substrate entirely composed living dead decomposed
sphagnum sphagnum wick moisture surfacesimultaneously acidifying soil nutrient seeped away
constant moisture often used sphagnum made
unavailable low soil since nutrient availability low
competition plant diminished allowing carnivorous
english sundew flourish
