wave disturbance propagates space spacetime
often transferring energy mechanical wave exists medium
deformation capable producing elastic restoring
force wave electromagnetic radiation probably gravitational
radiation travel vacuum without medium waves
travel transfer energy one point another littlepermanent displacement particle medium little
associated mass transport instead oscillation around
fixed positions

many year scientist trying work problemenergy transfer one place anotherespecially sound light
