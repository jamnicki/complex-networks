natural selection subdivided two categories
ecological selection occurs organism survivereproduce increase frequency gene gene pool

sexual selection occurs organism attractiveopposite sex feature reproduce thus
increase frequency feature gene pool

natural selection also operates mutation several different ways
positive directional selection increase frequencybeneficial mutation push mean either direction

biologist believe adaptation occurs accumulation
many mutation small effect however macromutationalternative process adaptation involves single large
scale mutation

recombination

asexual organism variant gene chromosomealways inherited togetherthey linked virtuedna molecule however sexual organism productiongamete shuffle linked allele homologous chromosome inherited
parent via meiotic recombination shuffling allows
independent assortment allele mutation gene propagated
population independently allows bad mutation purged
beneficial mutation retained efficientlyasexual populations

however meitoic recombination rate highon order
one crossover recombination event homomolgous chromosomes
per chromosome arm per generation therefore linked alleleperfectly shuffled away tend inherited
together tendency may measured comparing cooccurrence
two allele usually quantified linkage disequilibrium ldset allele often copropagated called haplotype
strong haplotype block product strong positive selection

recombination mildly mutagenic one proposed reasons
occurs limited frequency recombination also break gene
combination successful previous generationhence opposed selection however recombination couldfavoured negative frequencydependent selection rare
variant increase frequency lead individuals
new rare gene combination produced

allele cannot separated recombination examplemammalian chromosome observable reduction effective

becoming fixedthat going toorfrequency thus
fluctuation allele frequency successive generation may
result allele disappearing population due chance
