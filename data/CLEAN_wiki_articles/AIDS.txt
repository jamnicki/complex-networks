stigma

aid stigma exists around world variety way including
ostracism rejection discrimination avoidance hiv infected
people compulsory hiv testing without prior consent protectionconfidentiality violence hiv infected individual people
perceived infected hiv quarantine hiv

aid stigma divided following three
categories
instrumental aid stigmaa reflection fear apprehension
likely associated deadly transmissible
illness
symbolic aid stigmathe use hivaids express attitudes
toward social group lifestyle perceived associated
disease
