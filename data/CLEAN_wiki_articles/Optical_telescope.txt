focal length fratio

focal length determines wide angle telescope view
given eyepiece size ccd detector photographic plate
fratio focal ratio fnumber telescope ratio
focal length aperture diameterobjective thus given aperture lightgathering power low
fratios indicate wide field view widefield telescopeastrographs used track satellite asteroid cosmicray
research survey sky difficult reduce
optical aberration telescope low fratio telescopes
larger fratio
