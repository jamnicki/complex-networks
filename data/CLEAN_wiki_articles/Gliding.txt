gliding soaring recreational activity competitive sport

properly term gliding refers descending flightheavierthanair craft whereas soaring correct term usecraft gain altitude speed rising air

land elsewhere avoid using engines

club often addition aerotowing engine usually large
diesel though hydraulic fluid engine electrical motor also
used winch pull atomto foot

foot short steep ride

main advantage winch launch lower cost howeverlaunch height usually lower aerotow flight shorter
unless pilot quickly make contact source lift within
