cadaver testing

body late reliable data responsehuman body extreme physical insult effective tools
existed measure response biomechanics field barelyinfancy therefore necessary employ two type test
subject order develop initial data sets

first test subject human cadaver used obtain
fundamental information human body ability withstandcrushing tearing force typically experienced highspeed
accident end steel ball bearing dropped skulls
