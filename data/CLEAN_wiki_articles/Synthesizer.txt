electrical voltage generated synthesizer cause vibrationdiaphragm loudspeaker headphone etc synthesized sound
contrasted recording natural sound mechanical
energy sound wave transformed signalconverted back mechanical energy playback though sampling
synthesizer significantly blur distinction

synthesizer typically keyboard provides human
interface instrument often thought keyboard
instrument however synthesizer human interface doenecessarily keyboard doe synthesizer strictly need
playable human different fingerboard synthesizer ribbon
controlled synthesizer also developed see sound module

term speech synthesizer also used electronic speech
processing often connection vocoders

sound basics

natural tonal instrument sound analyzed frequency
domain spectrum tonal instrument exhibit amplitude peakharmonic harmonic frequency primarily located closeinteger multiple tone fundamental frequency

percussives rasp usually lack harmonic exhibit spectrumcomprised mainly noise shaped resonant frequencystructure produce sound resonant propertyinstrument spectral peak also referredformants also shape spectrum string wind voicenatural instruments

conventional synthesizer purpose resynthesis
recording real instrument thought composed several
components

component sound represent acoustic response different
part instrument sound produced instrumentdifferent part performance behaviour instrument
different playing condition pitch intensity playing
fingering etc distinctive timbre intonation attackreal instrument therefore created mixing togethercomponent way resembles natural behaviour real
instrument nomenclature varies synthesizer methodologymanufacturer component often referred oscillators
partial higher fidelity reproduction natural instrumenttypically achieved using oscillator increased
computational power human programming requiredsynthesizer use one four oscillator default

one important part sound amplitude envelope
envelope determines whether sound percussive like snare
drum persistent like violin string often shapingsound amplitude profile realized anadsr attack decay
sustain release envelope model applied control oscillator volumes
apart sustain stage modeled changevolume typically exponential
attack time time taken initial runup sound level
nil 
decay time time taken subsequent run 
designated sustain level
sustain level third stage steady volume producedkey heldrelease time time taken sound decaysustain level nil key released key released
attack decay stage sustain phase usually
skipped similarly sustain level zero producemoreorless pianolike percussive envelopecontinuous steady level even key held exponential rates
commonly used closely model real physical
vibration usually rise decay exponentially

although oscillation real instrument also change frequency
instrument modeled well without refinementrefinement necessary generate vibrato
