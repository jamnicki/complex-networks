turner syndrome encompasses several chromosomal abnormalitymonosomy common occurs inout every 
female birth instead normal sex chromosome female
one chromosome present fully functional called
x although genetic variant occur turner
syndrome female sexual characteristic present underdeveloped

symptoms

common symptom turner syndrome include
short stature
lymphoedema swelling hand feet
broad chest shield chest widelyspaced nipples
low hairline
lowset ears
reproductive sterility
amenorrhea absence menstrual period

symptom may include small lower jaw micrognathia cubitus
valgus turnedin elbow webbed neck soft upturned nail simian
crease drooping eyelid common pigmented mole hearing
loss higharch palate narrow maxilla turner syndrome
manifest differently female affected condition

ultrasound finding heart defect kidney abnormality cystic
hygroma ascities although recurrence risk increased
genetic counseling often recommended familypregnancy child turner syndrome

blood test called karyotype analyzes chromosomal composition

cognition however learning difficulty common among womanturner syndrome particularly specific difficulty perceiving
spatial relationship nonverbal learning disorder may
also manifest difficulty motor controlmathematics noncorrectable case doecause difficulty daily living

reproductive

woman turner syndrome almost universally infertilewoman turner syndrome successfully become pregnantcarried pregnancy term rare generally

use ivf fertility treatments

usually hormone replacement used spur growth secondary sexual
characteristic time puberty onset generally
induces menstruation though vast majority woman turner

treatment

chromosomal condition cure turner syndrome
however much done minimize symptom example
growth hormone either alone low dose androgenimprove growth probably final adult height growth hormoneapproved food drug administration treatmentturner syndrome covered many insurance plans

estrogen replacement therapy used since conditiondescribed promote development secondary sexual
characteristic estrogen also important maintaining good
tissue bone integrity

modern reproductive technology also used help women
