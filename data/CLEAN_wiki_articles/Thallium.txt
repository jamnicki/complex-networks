toxicity

thallium compound highly toxic handledgreat care contact skin dangerous adequate ventilation
provided melting metal thalliumi compoundhigh aqueous solubility readily absorbed skin
exposure exceedmg per skin hour
timeweighted average hour work week thallium suspected
human carcinogen

part reason thallium high toxicity present
aqueous solution univalent thalliumi ion tlexhibit similarity essential alkali metal cations
particularly potassium thus enter body via potassium uptake
pathway however aspect thallium chemistrydifferent alkali metal high affinitysulfur ligand substitution disrupts many cellular
