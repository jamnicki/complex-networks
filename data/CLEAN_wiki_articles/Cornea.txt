surgical procedure involving cornea

various refractive eye surgery technique change shapecornea order reduce need corrective lens otherwise
improve refractive state eye many technique used
today reshaping cornea performed photoablation usingexcimer laser

corneal stroma develops visually significant opacity
irregularity edema cornea deceased donortransplanted blood vessel corneaalso problem rejection new cornea

also synthetic cornea keratoprostheses development
merely plastic insert also composedbiocompatible synthetic material encourage tissue ingrowthsynthetic cornea thereby promoting biointegration

nonsurgical procedure involving cornea

orthokeratology method using specialized hard rigid
gaspermeable contact lens transiently reshape cornea order
improve refractive state eye reduce needeyeglass contact lenses
