background

naval tactic 

tactic called fleet approaching battle parallel columns
moving inline ahead allowing relatively easy maneuvering several
short column could change heading faster single long
column maintaining formation also signal made flagsearchlight flagship usually placed headcentre column could seen many ship singlecolumn formations
signal could takeminutes passed flagship
front column last ship end since smoke
funnel often made impossible identify signal ships
beyond one directly ahead behind every ship repeat
signal following one understand time requiredwa often doubled signal confirmed every
ship could executed
