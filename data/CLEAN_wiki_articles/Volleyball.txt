player specialization

player usually master six skill rather focus one
connection tactic employed team
common specialization comprises three positions
attackerblocker also differentiated outside middle
setter liberos defensive specialist

generally taller player ability jump high utilizedattackersblockers attempt block spike opponents
initial hit return ball high speed steep trajectoryball land team time react
setter task orchestrating offense team
aim second touch main responsibility place
ball air attacker hit ballopponent court easiest way possible able
operate hitter variety break enemys
block setter need swift skillful appraisaltactical accuracy must quick moving around court

liberos defensive specialist responsiblereceiving attack serve dig usually players
court quickest reaction time best passing
skill liberos necessarily need tall never
play net allowing shorter player strong passing
skill excel player designated libero match may
play role match

middle blocker middle hitter player performfast attack usually take place near setterspecialized blocking since must attempt stop equally
fast play opponent quickly set double
block side court general tallest
player often skillful defensive players

outside hitter also known power hitter attack nearantenna since set outside high outside
hitter may take longer approach sometimes even startingoutside court sideline outside hitter generally reliespowerful swing score offensive play may callangled approach andor quick attack confound defense
outside hitter must also master passing since generally help
libero receiving opponent serve strongside hitter

formations

three standard volleyball formation known asand
refers number hitter setter respectively
basic formation used beginner play whileisfar common formation highlevel play



theformation four hitter two setter setter usually
set middle front position rare competitivethe
setter often set right front position teamtherefore two frontrow attacker times

setter line opposite rotation typical
lineup two outside hitter aligning like position opposite
rotation always one position
front back row service player front row
move assigned position setter alwaysmiddle front alternatively setter move right frontha middle outside attacker disadvantage lies
lack offside hitter allowing one teams
blocker cheat middle block

clear disadvantage offensive formationtwo attacker leaving team fewer offensive weapons

another aspect see setter attacking force albeitweakened force setter front courtable tip dump ball close netsecond touch setter may opt hit ball one hand
mean blocker would otherwise blocksetter engaged may allow one hitter easier
attack



theformation player always come forward back row
set three front row player attacking positions
thus six player act hitter one time another two
act setter theformation actually asystembackrow setter penetrates set

thelineup thus requires two setter line oppositerotation addition setter typical lineup
two middle hitter two outside hitter aligning like
position opposite rotation always one
position front back row service players
front row move assigned positions

advantage theis always three frontrow
hitter available maximizing offensive possibility howeverdoe therequire team posse two people capableperforming highly specialized role setter also requiresplayer effective offensive hittersetter position international level cuban national
woman team employ kind formation also used womens
ncaa play partially due variant rule used allow 
substitution per set opposed theallowed standard
rules



theformation one assumes setting responsibilities
regardless position rotation teamtherefore three frontrow attacker setter back
row two setter front row totalfive

player opposite setter arotation called opposite
hitter general opposite hitter pas stand behind
teammate opponent serving opposite hitter may
used third attack option backrow attack setterfront row normal option used increase attack
capability modern volleyball team normally opposite hitter
technical skilled hitter team backrow attacks
generally come backright position positionbutincreasingly performed backcentre highlevel play

big advantage system setter always 
hitter vary set setter doe well opponents
middle blocker may enough time block outside
hitter increasing chance attacking team score

another advantage setter frontrow playerallowed jump dump ball onto opponent side
confuse opponent blocking player setterjump dump set one hitter good setter knows
thus wont jump dump set quick hitwell confuse opponent
