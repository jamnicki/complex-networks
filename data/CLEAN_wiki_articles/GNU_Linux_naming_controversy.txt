gnulinux term promoted free software foundation fsf
founder richard stallman supporter operating systems
include fsfs gnu utility linux kernel debian
gnulinux term name people simply
use term linux whole system

fsf argues term gnulinux gnu longstanding
project develop free operating system arguekernel final small piece proponent linux term
contend user developer overwhelmingly chosen keep
shorter name since gnu one many contributoroperating system whole name change justified

linuxbased operating system many component includinglinux kernel software developed gnu project wellsubstantial amount software window systemauthor linux kernel reported largest single
component smaller total amount code developed
gnu project typical linux distribution determining exactly
constitutes operating system per mattercontinuing debate however since single authoritydetermine demarcation

history

history linux closely tied gnu operating
system plan gnu made inand september year
announced publicly software development work beganjanuarygnu complete unixlike operating system
composed entirely free software bywhen first versionlinux kernel released gnu midlevel portionoperating system almost complete upper level couldsupplied window system lower level kernel device
driver systemlevel utility daemon still mostly lacking
early linux kernel developer adapted linux specifically work
gnu later gnu developer learned linuxadapted part gnu work linux thus filled last major
gap gnu operating system gnu kernel gnu hurd stillinfancy hurd followed ambitious design proved
unexpectedly difficult implement marginally
usable

inthe yggdrasil linux distribution adopted name
linuxgnux name gnulinux first used debian 
gnu junebulletin linux referred free unix clone
many gnu utility library januaryedition
term gnulinux used instead maystallman released
emacswith system target linux changed lignux also
suggesting alternative linuxbased gnu system gnulinux
system stallman later used gnulinux exclusively

argument gnulinux

fsf advocate gnulinux simply large numbergnu component used linuxbased system quantity gnu
source code goal gnu project specifically
develop complete operating system

going pick name system basedwrote program system appropriate single choice
would gnu dont think right way consider
question gnu project project develop
specific software packagesmany people made major
contribution free software systemdeserve credit reason integrated systemandcollection useful programsis gnu project
set make one made list program neededmake complete free system systematically wrote found
people write everything list

fsf argues name issue important way crediting
technical contribution gnu project idealismgnu freesoftware philosophy opposed opensource
movement

calling system gnulinux recognizes role idealism
played building community help public recognizepractical importance ideals

calling variant gnu system linux play hands
people choose software based technical
advantage caring whether respect freedom

ordinary understanding operating system includeskernelthe specific subsystem directly interfacehardwareand theuserland software employed user
application software control computer moreovername gnu name linux intentionally related name
unix unix always conceptually included libraryuserland tool well kernel therelease noteversionstoof linux released gnu

sadly kernel get nowhere get working system
need shell compiler library etc separate parts
may stricter even looser copyrighttool used linux gnu software gnu

info

use word linux refer kernel operating
system entire distribution often lead confusiondistinction three many important gnu packagekey part almost every linux distribution medium sources
frequently make erroneous statement claiming entire
linux operating system rather simply kernel writtenscratch torvalds inthat torvalds directs developmentcomponent graphical interface gnu toolnew release kernel involve similar degree uservisible
change new version proprietary operating systemmicrosoft window many thing besides kernel change
simultaneously

confusion legal threat public relation campaigns
apparently directed kernel launchedsco group alexis tocqueville institution adtimisinterpreted many commentator assume whole operating
system targeted organisation even accuseddeliberately exploiting confusion

generally scos caldera ibm complaint vague confusingwhether accusation involve linux kernel gnulinux
operating system linux distribution linux applicationwhatever mike angelo mozillaquest magazine 

sco used linux mean free software free
software constituting unixlike operating system confusion
free software foundation warned pastshown misleading consequence foundationoften predictedeben moglen 

guess glad world found hard say
gnulinux sco fell right pit equating linuxkernel gnulinux everything kernel plusapplicationspamela jones groklaw 

particular stallman criticized theken brownadti reportcapitalizing common confusion linux kernelstallman say linus really wrote full gnu operating
system associated software generally used

response suggestion stallmans renaming effort stemegotism personal pique rms responded interestgiving credit gnu project

people think want ego fedcourse asking call stallmanix

stallman admitted irritation although beliefjustified

thread annoying please imagine like seeidealistic project stymied made ineffective people
dont usually give credit done youreidealist like ruin whole decade

response another common argument see fsf
acknowledges many people contributed gnulinuxshort name cannot credit argues cannot
justify calling system linux

since long namegnuxapachelinuxtexperlpythonfreeciv becomes absurdpoint set threshold omit namemany secondary contribution one obvious right
place set threshold wherever set wont argue
itbut one name cannot result concernfairness giving credit possible threshold levellinux cant fair give credit one secondary
contribution linux omitting principal contribution
gnu

argument linux

linux far widespread name people therefore
simply adopt usage reference naming controversy
appear infrequently mainstream source linux hahistorical momentum name torvalds usedcombined system sincewhile stallman began asking peoplecall system gnulinux mid timelinux name already become popular linux shorter easier
say gnulinux particularly given stallmans suggested
pronunciation guhnuslashlinux guhnupluslinux

eric raymond writes linux entry jargon file

people object name linux used refer
kernel entire operating system claimproxy underlying territorial dispute people insistterm gnulinux want fsf get credit linux
rms stallman friend wrote many userlevel
tool neither theory term gnulinux gainedminority acceptance

linus torvalds said documentary revolution askedname gnulinux justified

well think justified justified actually
make gnu distribution linuxthe way thinkred hat linux fine suse linux debian linuxactually make distribution linux get name
thing calling linux general gnu linux thinkridiculous

editorial linux journal expressed common speculationstallmans advocacy combined name attempt unfairly ride
coattail linux fame

perhaps rms frustrated linus got glory rms
wanted
see stallmans response linux journal article
quote linus torvalds saying

umm discussion gone quite long enough thankmuch doesnt really matter people call linux longcredit given credit due side personally
ill much continue call linux

similar vein debate name operating systemsometimes characterized trivial distraction john dvorak
wrote

unfortunately linux community spends much energything nomenclature like name gnulinux versus linux

others suggested regardless merit stallmans
persistence sometimes seems lost cause make gnu look
bad example larry mcvoy author proprietary software
bitkeeper used manage linux kernel development opinedclaiming credit make one look foolish greedy

many user vendor prefer name linux pointinclusion nongnu nonkernel tool apache http server
x window system desktop environment enduser operating
system based linux kernel stated jim gettys originator
x

lot people bus dont hear clamorsupport gnu essential manycomponent cant take wheel away end functional
vehicle engine seat recommend happybus

see fsf response acknowledges practical limitcredit draw different conclusion

mainstream usage name linux often usedstandard example concept software content may
freely modified redistributed even usage generallymention gnu free software specifically

case gnulinux inapplicable

embedded system handheld device linux kernelused component gnu alternative like uclibc
busybox replacing gnu tool even single application
running processon bare kernel everyone including fsf
agrees gnulinux appropriate namecircumstance almost linuxbased desktop server usegnu component glibc gnu library coreutils bash

pronunciation

article contains nonstandard pronunciation informationrewritten using international phonetic alphabet please
see wikipediamanual style pronunciation help

although gnulinux often pronounced gnu linux stallmanadvocated explicit pronunciation slash prevent confusing
implication linux kernel gnu project

prefer pronounce gnuslashlinux gnupluslinuxreason say gnulinux much pronesuggest misleading interpretation gnu emacs
version emacs developed gnusay gnu linux people think mean version linuxwa developed gnu fact

given stallman pronounces gnu guhnu pronounce hard
g would make guhnuslashlinux guhnupluslinux
