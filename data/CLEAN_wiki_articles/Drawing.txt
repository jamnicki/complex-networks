materials

paper come variety different size quality rangingnewspaper grade practice high quality relatively
expensive paper sometimes sold individual sheet paper varytexture hue acidity strength wet smooth paper goodrendering fine detail toothy paper hold drawing
material better thus coarse material useful producing
deeper contrast

pen ink work typing paper often used practice drawings
heavier paper hold better bristol board make hard surface
especially good ink fine detailed graphite drawing
coldpressed watercolor paper sometimes favored ink drawing due
texture tracing vellum often used experimenting top
pencil drawing prior committing technique final page
