observation emotion man animal traditionmutually exclusive many researcher incorporate multiple
perspective work
darwinian perspective

first articulated late century charles darwin emotions
evolved via natural selection therefore crossculturally
universal counterpart research area focusedphysical display emotion including body language animalfacial expression human paul ekman work basic emotionrepresentative darwinian tradition
jamesian perspective

william james believed emotional experiencelargely due experience bodily change change mightvisceral postural facially expressive however physiological
aspect theory empirically discredited walter cannonsecond edition bodily change pain hunger fear rage
cognitive perspective

many researcher believe thought particular cognitive
appraisal environment underlying causal explanationemotional processes
social constructivist perspective

social constructivism emphasizes importance culture context
