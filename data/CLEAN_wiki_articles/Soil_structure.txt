overview

natural aggregate clearly seen field called
peds clod hand aggregate brokenshape artificial action tillage surface peds

structure important since along soil texture affects
porosity soil dense structure greatly reduceamount air water move freely soil alsoaffect plant ability propagate root soil

types

five major class structure seen soil platy
prismatic columnar granular blocky also structureless
condition soil simple structure unit entity
without component smaller unit others compound structurelarge unit composed smaller unit separated persistent
plane weakness

platy

platy structure unit flat platelikegenerally oriented horizontally special form lenticular platy
structure recognized plate thickest middlethin toward edge platy structure usually found subsurface
soil subject leaching compaction animalmachinery plate separated little effort prying
horizontal layer pen knife platy structure tends impede
downward movement water plant root soil

prismatic

prismatic structure individual unit bounded flatrounded vertical face unit distinctly longer verticallyface typically cast mold adjoining unit vertexangular subrounded top prism somewhat indistinct
normally flat prismatic structure characteristic horizon subsoil vertical crack result freezingthawing wetting drying well downward movementwater roots

columnar

columnar structure unit similar prism bounded
flat slightly rounded vertical face top columncontrast prism distinct normally rounded
columnar structure common subsoil sodium affected soils
columnar structure dense difficult plant
root penetrate layer technique deep plowinghelp restore degree fertility soils

blocky

blocky structure structural unit blocklike polyhedral
bounded flat slightly rounded surface castface surrounding peds typically blocky structural unitnearly equidimensional grade prism plate structure
described angular blocky face intersect relatively
sharp angle subangular blocky face mixturerounded plane face corner mostly rounded blocky
structure common subsoil also occur surface soilhigh clay content strongest blocky structure formedresult swelling shrinking clay mineral produce
crack sometimes surface driedup slough pond shows
characteristic cracking peeling due clays

granular

granular structure structural unit approximately spherical
polyhedral bounded curved irregular facecast adjoining peds word look like cookie
crumb granular structure common surface soil rich
grassland highly amended garden soil high organic matter
content soil mineral particle separated bridgedorganic matter breakdown product soil biota exudate makingsoil easy work cultivation earthworm frost action rodents
mix soil decrease size peds structure allows
good porosity easy movement air water combination
ease tillage good moisture air handling capabilitygood structure planting germination definitivephrase good tilth

structureless

soil lack structure referred structurelessstructureless layer horizon unit observable placesoil gently disturbed tapping spade
containing slice soil hard surface dropping large
fragment ground structureless soil ruptured soil
fragment single grain result structureless soil material
may either single grain massive soil material single grains
lack structure addition loose
