several perspective established within theorylearning used educational psychology formed contestedinclude behaviorism cognitivism social cognitivismconstructivism section summarizes educational psychologyresearched applied theory within perspectives

behavioural perspective

applied behaviour analysis set technique basedbehavioural principle operant conditioning effective range

behaviour systematically rewarding student follow classroom

social cognitive perspective

social cognitive theory highly influential fusion behavioural
