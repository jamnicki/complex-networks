physic matter commonly defined substancephysical object composed counting contribution various
energy force field usually considered matter
per though may contribute mass object matter
constitutes much observable universe although lightordinarily considered matter unfortunately scientific
purpose matter somewhat loosely defined

definition

colloquially chemistry matter easier defineassociated quantitative aspect mass matterponderable object made consists identifiable chemical
substance made atom made protons
neutron electron way matter contrasted energy

physic broad consensus exact definitionmatter physicist generally use word precisionneeded prefering instead speak clearly defined concepts
mass invariant mass energy particles

fermion definition

possible definition matter least physicist usematter everything constituted truly elementary
particle called fermion fermion spin particlethought substructure include lepton best
example familiar electron also quarks
including quark proton neutronmade since proton neutron electron combine form atombulk substance made atom made fermionic
matter

scheme matter also includes various highenergyshortlived baryon delta particle never seen
except physic experiment also meson thingmatter would include lightphotons massless gauge

usage note regarding matter antimatter

semantic difficulty word matter since two
meaning includes matter may mean either
opposite antimatter electron positrons
matter defined previous line antimatter electron positrons

difficulty occurs word particle

property matter

individual particles

quark combine form hadron principle colour
confinement occurs strong interaction quark never exist
unbound quark among hadron protonneutron usually nucleus surrounded cloud electronnucleus many electron proton thus electrically neutral
called atom otherwise ion

lepton feel strong force exist unboundparticle earth electron generally bound atomeasy free fact exploited cathode ray
tube muon may briefly form bound state known muonic atoms
neutrino feel neither strong electromagnetic interactions
never bound particles

phases

bulk matter exist several different phase accordingpressure temperature phase state macroscopic physical

strange matter quarkgluon plasma also paramagnetic
ferromagnetic phase magnetic material condition change
matter may change one phase another phenomenoncalled phase transition energetics studied field

different bulk material may well describedphase

phase sometimes called state matter term leadconfusion thermodynamic state example two gas maintained
