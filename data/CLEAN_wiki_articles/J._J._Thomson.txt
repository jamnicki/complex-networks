thomson conducted series experiment cathode ray tubeled discovery electron subatomic particles

thomson first experiment

first experiment investigated whether negative
charge could separated cathode ray mean magnetism
constructed cathode ray tube ending pair cylinderslit slit turn connected electrometer
thomson found ray magnetically bentcould enter slit electrometer registered little charge
thomson concluded negative charge inseparablerays

third experiment thomson measured chargetomass ratiocathode ray measuring much deflectedmagnetic field much energy carried foundcharge mass ratio thousand time higherproton suggesting either particle lighthighly charged
