general weaknesses

league long term succeed outbreak world
war wa immediate cause league demisealso variety fundamental flaws

league like modern united nation lacked armed forcedepended great power enforce resolutions
reluctant economic sanctionsevere measure league could implement short military
action difficult enforce great impact target
country could simply trade outside league
problem exemplified following passage takenessential fact league nation handbook publishedgeneva 

regard military sanction provided paragraph 
articlethere legal obligation applymay political moral duty incumbent stateobligation
league two important member britain francereluctant use sanction even reluctant resortmilitary action behalf league soon world warpopulation government two country pacifistbritish conservative especially tepid leaguepreferred government negotiate treaty withoutinvolvement organization ultimately britain franceabandoned concept collective security favour appeasement
face growing german militarism adolf hitler

representation league often problem thoughintended encompass nation many never joined timepart league short one key weakness league waunited state never joined took away much leagues
potential power even though president woodrow wilsondriving force behind league formation united state senate
voted novembernot join league

league also weakened main power leftjapan began permanent member councilwithdrew inafter league voiced opposition invasionchinese territory manchuria italy also began permanent
member council withdrew inthe league accepted
germany member indeeming peaceloving countryadolf hitler pulled germany came power inanother
major power bolshevik soviet union member 
joined antagonise germany left yeardecemberwhen expelled aggressionfinland

league neutrality tended manifest indecisionleague required unanimous vote nine later fifteen member
council enact resolution conclusive effective actiondifficult impossible also slow comingdecision decision also required unanimous consentassembly agreement every member league

another important weakness league tried represent
nation member protected national interests
committed league goal reluctanceleague member use option military action showedfull league shown resolve initially countries
government dictator may wary risking wrath
later year failing part among reasonoutbreak world war 
moreover league advocacy disarmament britain france
member whilst time advocating collective
security meant league unwittingly deprivingforceful mean authority would upheldleague force country abide international
law would primarily royal navy french armywould fighting furthermore britain francepowerful enough enforce international law across globe evenwished member league obligation meantwa danger state would get drawn international disputes
directly affect respective national interests

onjunein wake collapse league effortrestrain italy war conquest abyssinia british prime
minister stanley baldwin told house common collective
security failed ultimately reluctance nearlynation europe proceed might call military
sanction real reason main reason wadiscovered process week country exceptaggressor country ready war collective actionreality merely thing talked meanevery country ready war must ready war terrible thing essential part
collective security accurate assessment lesson
clearly applied formation north atlantic treaty
organisation stood league successor insofar role
guarantor security western europe concerned

voivodship theoretically british french troop couldasked enforce league decision however france wishantagonise poland seen possible ally future war
germany soviet union britain preparedact alone britain france also wished polandbuffer zone europe possible threat communist
russia eventually league accepted wilno polish town march
thus pole able keep soviet invasion

lithuanian authority declined accept polish authorityvilna treated constitutional capital waultimatum lithuania resolved diplomatic relationpoland thus facto accepted border neighbour

ruhr
