borlaug hypothesis

borlaug continually advocated increasing crop yield meancurb deforestation large role played increasing
crop yield promoting view led calledagricultural economist borlaug hypothesis namelyincreasing productivity agriculture best farmlandhelp control deforestation reducing demand new farmland
according view assuming global food demandrise restricting crop usage traditional lowyield methodorganic farming would also require least one followingworld population decrease either voluntarily result mass
starvation conversion forest land crop landthus argued highyield technique ultimately saving ecosystems
destruction global scale view hold strictly true
ceteris paribus land either consists forest usedagriculture land exist urban area pasture
fallow research necessary ascertain landconverted purpose order determine trueview remains increased profit highyield production may also
induce cropland expansion case although world food needs
decrease expansion may decrease well
