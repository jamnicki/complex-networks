sail

spinosaurus sail unusual although dinosaurtime area namely ornithopod ouranosaurus sauropod
rebbachisaurus developed similar structural adaptationdorsal vertebra sail possibly analogous homologouspermian mammallike reptile dimetrodon liveddinosaur even appeared similarity presumably dueparallel evolution

purpose sail uncertain scientist proposed
several hypotheses
heat regulator sail contained abundant blood vesselanimal could used sail large surface area absorb
heat would imply animal partly warmblooded
best lived climate nighttime temperaturecool low sky usually cloudy thoughtspinosaurus ouranosaurus lived marginearlier version sahara desert could explainalso possible sail used radiate excess heatbody rather collect large animal duerelatively small ratio surface area body comparedoverall volume haldane principle face far greater problems
dissipating excess heat higher temperature gaininglower sail dinosaur added considerably skin

angle towards cooling wind animal would quite effectivly
cool warm climate cretaceous africa
sexual display elaborate body structure many modernday
animal usually serve attract member opposite sexmating quite possible sail dinosaurus
used courtship way similar peacock tailwa case sail may brightly coloredpurely speculative
intimidating device sail possibly used intimidate
rival frighten enemy making animal appear bigger
wa dinosaur could display sail final warning
signal would resort open attack like modernday
rattlesnake use tail

finally since thing nature rarely develop singular reason
quite possible sail combined function acting
normally heat regulator becoming courting aid mating
season used cool occasion turningintimidating device animal feeling threathened conjecture
may even allow sail may changed colourfunctions
