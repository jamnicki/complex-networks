american strategy

u moon exploration program originated eisenhower
administration series mids article colliers
magazine wernher von braun popularized idea manned
expedition moon establish lunar base manned moon landing
posed several daunting technical challenge usa ussr
besides guidance weight management atmospheric reentry without
ablative overheating major hurdle soviet unions

united state government believed potentialscientific military reward failed justify expenseoperation

early soviet success especially yuri gagarin flight
u president john kennedy looked american projectwould capture public imagination asked vice president lyndon
johnson make recommendation scientific endeavor would
prove world leadership proposal included nonspace options
massive irrigation project end famine third world
potential space mission attempted determined
u would best chance beating sovietrace moon landing soviet timepowerful rocket united state advance nuclear
weapon technology led smaller lighter warheadconsequently rocket smaller payload capacity comparison
soviet nuclear weapon much heavier powerful rocket
wa developed carry modest potential missionflying around moon without landing establishing space laborbit proposed kennedy von braun determinedoffer much advantage soviet since woulddevelop heavy rocket match soviet moon landing however
would offer best chance success sincecountry would develop technology scratch
