sun yatsen first proposed building dam yangtze river 
power generation purpose national defense planning
commission kuomintang made first survey proposed
site inbut idea shelved due unfavorable politicaleconomic condition major flood resurrected idea prc
government adopted infor flood control

vice minister electric power rui initially argued dam
multipurpose smaller dam built firstchina could afford costly project constructionproceed stage allow time solve technical problems

later rui concluded dam built since
would costly flood many city fertile farmland subject
middle lower reach river catastrophic flooding
construction would contribute much shipping sichuan
province official also objected construction since sichuan
located upstream would shoulder cost downstream
hubei province would receive benefits

lin yishan head yangtze valley planning office wacharge project favored dam construction howeveroptimism resolving technical problem encouragedfavorable political climate support late
