model organism genetics

drosophila melanogaster studied organism biological
research particularly genetics developmental biologyseveral reasons
small easy grow laboratory
ha short generation time aboutweeks high
productivity female layeggs indays
mature larva show giant chromosome salivary glands
called polytene chromosomespuffs indicate regiontranscription hence gene activity
ha onlypairs chromosomesautosomal andsex
male show meiotic recombination facilitating genetic
studies
genetic transformation technique available since 
compact genome sequenced

another often first exhibit cleaning behaviorbehaviour engaged time male proceed towardsrear female either left right sidebegin dance describes semicircle around female
