vision

vitamin required production rhodopsin visual
pigment used low light level eating food richvitamin said allow see dark

epithelial cells

vitamin essential correct functioning epithelial cells
vitamin deficiency mucussecreting cell replaced keratin
producing cell leading xerosis

glycoprotein synthesis

glycoprotein synthesis requires adequate vitamin status severe
vitamin deficiency lack glycoprotein may lead corneal ulcers
liquefaction

immune system

growth

retinoic acid retinyl palmitate isotretinoin tretinoin retinol
used medicinally topical treatment acne keratosis
pilaris isotretinoin also used orally trade names
accutane roaccutane generally severe recalcitrant acne

cosmetic vitamin derivative used socalled antiaging

vitamin deficiency

vitamin deficiency common developing country rarely seen

vitamin deficiency also diminishes ability fight infections
country child immunized infectious disease like
measles relatively higher fatality rate elucidated alfred sommer even mild subclinical deficiency also problem
may increase childrens risk developing respiratorydiarrheal infection decrease growth rate slow bone developmentdecrease likelihood survival serious illness

addition dietary problem cause vitamindeficiency iron deficiency affect vitamin uptake excess alcohol
