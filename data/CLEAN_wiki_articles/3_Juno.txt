juno one largest asteroid containing approximatelythe
mass entire asteroid belt ranking size tenthvies witheunomia honour largest stony
stype asteroid although newest estimate put juno second
place amongst stypes unusually reflective mayindicative different surface property high reflectivity

juno originally considered planet along withcerespallas

many additional asteroid discovered juno small size
irregular shape preclude considered dwarf planet
