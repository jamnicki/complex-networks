nomenclature

nomenclature refers system naming chemical compoundwelldefined system place naming chemical specie organic
compound named according organic nomenclature system
inorganic compound named according inorganic nomenclature

chemical laws

fundamental concept chemistry law conservationmass state detectable change quantity
matter ordinary chemical reaction modern physic shows
actually energy conserved energy mass
related concept becomes important nuclear chemistry
conservation energy lead important concept equilibrium
thermodynamics kinetics

law chemistry elaborate law conservation mass
joseph proust law definite composition say pure chemicals

dalton law multiple proportion say chemicalpresent proportion small whole number oh water although many system notably biomacromolecules
mineral ratio tend require large numberfrequently represented fraction compound knownnonstoichiometric compounds
