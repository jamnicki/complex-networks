water purification techniques

popular method purifying water especially local private
supply listed country methodalso used large scale municipal supply particularly important
distillation desalination seawater reverse osmosis
boiling water heated hot enough long enough inactivate
kill microorganism normally live water room
temperature near sea level vigorous rolling boil least
one minute sufficient high altitude greater two
kilometer orfeet three minute recommended epa
emergency disinfection recomendations area waterhard containing significant dissolved calcium salts
boiling decomposes bicarbonate ion resulting partial
precipitation calcium carbonate fur builds
kettle element etc hard water areaexception calcium boiling doe remove solute higher
boiling point water fact increase concentration
due water lost vapour boiling doe leaveresidual disinfectant water therefore water haboiled stored length time may acquired new
pathogens
carbon filtering charcoal form carbon high surface
area absorbs many compound including toxic compound water
passing activated charcoal common household water
filter fish tank household filter drinking water
sometimes contain silver release silver ionbactericidal effect
distillation involves boiling water produce water vapour
vapour contact cool surface condenses liquid
solute normally vaporised remainboiling solution even distillation doe completely purify
water contaminant similar boiling pointdroplet unvaporised liquid carried steam however
pure water obtained distillation distillationconfer residual disinfectant distillation apparatus

reverse osmosis mechanical pressure applied impure
solution force pure water semipermeable membrane
reverse osmosis theoretically thorough method large
scale water purification available although perfect semipermeable
membrane difficult create unless membranewellmaintained algae life form colonisemembranes
