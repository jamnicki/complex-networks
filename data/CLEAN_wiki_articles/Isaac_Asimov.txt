literary themes

spoiler warning plot andor ending detail follow

much asimov fiction dealt theme paternalism first
robot storyrobbie concerned robotic nanny lenny dealcapacity robopsychologist susan calvin feel maternal love towards
robot whose positronic brain capacity yearoldrobot grew sophisticated intervention becamewidereaching subtle inevidence robot masqueradinghuman successfully run elective office inthe evitable
conflict robot run humanity behind scene actingnanny whole species

later robot dawn robot empire robot develops
call zeroth law robotics state robot
may injure humanity inaction allow humanity come
harm also decides robotic presence stifling humanitys
freedom best course action robot phase
nonrobot time travel novel end eternity
feature similar conflict resolution significancezeroth law outweighs supersedes lawrobotics robot find situation whereby must
murder one human direct violation first lawrobotics order protect humanity preserve zeroth
law robot positronic programming requirecommit murder humanity sake

foundation series originally robotscientist implement semisecret plan create new galactic empire
course ofyears series version platonic
guardian called second foundation perfect protectplan asimov stopped writing series second
foundation depicted benign protector humanityrevisited series made paternalistic themes
even explicit

foundation edge introduced planet gaia obviously basedgaia hypothesis every animal plant mineral gaia participated
shared consciousness forming single supermind working together
greater good foundation earth protagonist must
decide whether allow development galaxia larger
version gaia encompassing entire galaxy gaia oneasimov best attempt exploring possibility collective
awareness compounded nemesis planet
erythro composed primarily prokaryotic life mindseek communion human beings

foundation earth introduces robot foundation universe two
asimov last novel prelude foundation forwardfoundation explore behaviour fuller detail robotdepicted covert operative acting benefit humanity

another frequent theme perhaps reverse paternalism social
oppression current space take place planetunique plant fibre grown agricultural workerexploited aristocrat nearby planet star like
dust hero help planet oppressed arrogant
interplanetary empire tyranni

often victim oppression either earth people opposedcolonist planet robot bicentennial manrobot fight prejudice accepted human cavesteel people earth resent wealthier spacers turn

decide whether help downtrodden society thinkdead

yet another frequent theme asimov rational thought invented
