tractatus

rough order first half book set forth following
theses
world consists independent atomic factsexisting stateaffairsout larger fact built
language consists atomic largerscale propositions
correspond fact sharing logical form
thought expressed language picture facts
analyse thought sentence express expressshow say true logical form
cannot analyse cannot meaningfully discussed
philosophy consists form analysis wovon
man nicht sprechen kann darber man schweigen whereof one
cannot speak thereof one must silent

commentator believe although type discourseproperly speaking philosophy wittgenstein doe implything passed silence may important useful
according cryptic proposition last sections
tractatus indeed may importantuseful wrote tractatus letterpublisher ficker

point book ethical wanted give words
foreword actually however
ill write might key wanted
write work consists two part oneeverything written preciselysecond part important one ethical delimitedwithin book convinced strictly
speaking delimited way brief think
many babbling defined bookremaining silent
wittgenstein letter ludwig von ficker october november
translated ray monk

commentator point sentence tractatus would
qualify meaningful according rigid criterionwittgenstein method book doe follow demands
regarding strictly correct philosophical method alsoadmitted wittgenstein writes propositionmy
proposition elucidatory way understands finally
recognizes senseless commentator believe book
deeply ironic demonstrates ultimate nonsensicality
sentence attempting say something metaphysical something
