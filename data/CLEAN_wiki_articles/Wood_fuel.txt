wood burning largest current use biomass derived energy wood
used solid fuel cooking heating occasionallysteam engines

use wood fuel source home heat oldcivilization historically limited usedistribution technology required make spark wood heat still
common throughout much world although mainly
replaced coal oil natural gas heating wood heating hasingled serious health hazard many region world

early example include use wood heat tent fireconstructed ground smoke hole top tent
allowed smoke escape convection

permanent structure hearth constructedsurfaces stone
another noncombustible material upon fire could built
smoke escaped smoke hole roof

development chimney fireplace allowedeffective exhaustion smoke masonry heater stove wentstep capturing much heat fire exhaustlarge thermal mass becoming much efficient fireplace
alone

metal stove technological development concurrentindustrial revolution stove manufactured constructed pieces
equipment contained fire side provided means
controlling draftthe amount air allowed reachfire stove made variety material cast ironamong common soapstone talc tile steelused metal stove often lined refractory materialfirebrick since hottest part woodburning fire burn away
steel course several year use

franklin stove developed united state benjamin
franklin manufactured fireplace stove open
front heat exchanger back designed draw air
cellar heat releasing side heat
exchanger never popular feature omitted later
version socalled franklin stove today made great variety
style though none resembles original design

airtight stove originally made steel allowed greater control
combustion tightly fitted stove day
airtight stove became common century

energy content

roughly equal wood varieties

however heating potential firewood per cubic meter per log
varies widely depending upon specie tree wood

many small manufacturer producing stove based design oldnew notable innovation era include ashley heaterthermostaticallycontrolled stove optional perforated steel
enclosure prevented accidental contact hot surfaces

number dualfuel furnace boiler made utilized
ductwork piping deliver heat throughout housebuilding

growth popularity wood heat also led developmentmarketing greater variety equipment cutting splitting
