project history

part planning international geophysical year
u publicly undertook place artificial satellite
scientific experiment orbit around earth

three service proposals

proposal presented united state air forceunited state army united state navy army abmadr wernher von braun suggested using modified redstone rocket
see juno air force proposed using atlas rocket
yet exist navy proposed designing rocket system
based viking aerobee rocket system purposelaunching first satellite

augustthe dod committee special capability chosenavy proposal appeared likely springfulfill
following
place satellite orbit igy
accomplish scientific experiment orbit
track satellite ensure attainment orbit

another consideration navy proposal used civilian rockets
rather military missile considered inappropriatepeaceful scientific exploration designated project vanguardprogram placed navy management dod monitorship naval

slightly pearshaped perfectly round corrected ideaatmosphere density high altitude improved accuracyworld maps

nrl space scientist say vanguard program introduced muchtechnology since applied later satellite
program rocket launching satellite tracking exampleproved solar cell could used several year power radio
transmitter vanguard solar cell operated seven years
conventional battery used power another onboard transmitter
lasted onlydays

although vanguard solarpowered voice became silent init
continues serve scientific community groundbased trackingnowinert vanguard continues provide informationeffect sun moon atmosphere satellite orbit vanguardmarked year space marchin year following
