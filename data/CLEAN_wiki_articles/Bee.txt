pollination

bee play important role pollinating flowering plantmajor type pollinator ecosystem contain flowering
plant bee may focus gathering nectar gathering pollen
depending greater need time bee gathering nectar may
accomplish pollination bee deliberately gathering pollen
efficient pollinator estimated one thirdhuman food supply depends insect pollinationaccomplished bees
