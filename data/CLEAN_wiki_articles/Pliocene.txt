land mass collision meant great migration mixing previously
isolated specie herbivore got bigger specialized predators

pliocene oceans

ocean continued relatively warm pliocene though
continued cooling arctic ice cap formed drying climateincreasing cool shallow current north atlantic deep cold
current flowed antarctic

formation isthmus panama aboutmillion year ago cut
final remnant essentially circumequatorial
current existed since cretaceous early cenozoic
may contributed cooling ocean worldwide

lightyears earth one supernova may occurred
