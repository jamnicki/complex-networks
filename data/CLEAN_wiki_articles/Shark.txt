respiration

major feature sharks

like fish shark extract oxygen seawater passes
gill shark modified slit called spiracle
located behind eye used respiration duesize nature metabolism many shark higher
demand oxygen bony fish cannot rely ambient water
current provide adequate supply oxygenated watershark stop swimming water circulation would droplevel necessary respiration animal would suffocateprocess ensuring adequate flow gill forward movement
