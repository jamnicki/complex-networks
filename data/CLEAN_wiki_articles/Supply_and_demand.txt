sloping case however supply curve slope
upwards well known example supply curve labor
backward bending supply curve labour person wage increases
willing supply greater number hour workingwage reach extremely high amount say wage ofper

demand

demand economic want backed purchasing power ieplan relationship expressing different amount product buyers
willing able buy possible price assumingnonprice factor remain example consumer maywilling purchaselb potato price isper however consumer may willing purchase onlylbprice isper demand schedule constructed shows
quantity demanded given price representedgraph line curve plotting quantity demandedprice also described mathematically demand equation
main determinant quantity one willing purchasetypically price good one level income personal
taste price substitute good price complementary
goods

shape aggregated demand curve convex concave
possibly depending income distribution

capacity buy sometimes used characterise demandmerely alternate form supply

elasticity

important concept understanding supply demand theoryelasticity context refers supply demand change
response various stimulus one way defining elasticitypercentage change one variable divided percentage changeanother variable known arch elasticity calculateselasticity range value contrast point elasticity
us differential calculus determine elasticityspecific point thus measure relative changes

often useful know quantity supplied demandedchange price change known price elasticitydemand price elasticity supply monopolist decidesincrease price product affect sales
revenue increased unit price offset likely decreasesale volume government imposes tax good thereby
increasing effective price affect quantity
demanded

wish calculate elasticity simpler techniquelook slope curve unfortunately unitmeasurement quantity monetary unit example liter per
euro battleship per million yen convenient
measure use purpose example wantedcompare effect price change gasoline europe versusunited state complicated conversion gallon per
dollar liter per euro one reason economists
often use relative change percentage elasticity another
reason elasticity slope function
slope function coordinate space line
constant slope different elasticity various points

let example calculation said one waycalculating elasticity percentage change quantitypercentage change price price move fromto 
quantity supplied frompens topens slopeorpens per dollar since elasticity dependspercentage quantity pen increased byand price
increased byso price elasticity supply isor 

since change percentage changing unit measurement
currency affect elasticity quantity
demanded supplied change lot price change littlesaid elastic quantity change little prices
change lot said inelastic example perfectly

another elasticity sometimes considered cross elasticity
demand measure responsiveness quantity demanded
good change price another good often
considered looking relative change demand studying

vertical supply curve

sometimes case supply curve verticalquantity supplied fixed matter market priceexample amount land world considered fixedcase matter much someone would willing paypiece land extra cannot created also even one wanted
land still would exist land considered way
warrant vertical supply curve giving zero elasticity
ie matter large change price quantity supplied
change hand supply useful landincreased response demandby irrigation landotherwise would sea level kept dry systemdike might also regarded response demand evencase vertical line bit simplification

short run near vertical supply curve commonexample super bowl next week increasing number seats
stadium almost impossible supply ticket game
considered vertical case organizerevent underestimated demand may well caseprice set equilibrium price caselikely people paid lower price valueticket price people could get ticket even though
would willing pay people valueticket sell people willing pay scalp ticket effective price riseequilibrium price

example supply demand person economy

supply demand thought term individual people
interacting market suppose following six people participate
simplified economy
alice willing payfor sack potatoes
bob willing payfor sack potatoes
cathy willing payfor sack potatoes

dan willing sell sack potato 
emily willing sell sack potato 
fred willing sell sack potato 

many possible trade would mutually agreeablepeople happen example cathy fred
would interested trading priceandif price abovecathy interested since
price high price belowfredinterested since price low however market cathy
discover seller willing sell well
belowso trade fred efficient
market seller get high price possiblebuyer get low price possible

imagine cathy fred bartering price fred offers
sack potato cathy agree emily offer sack
potato forfred willing sell atso drops
point dan offer sell foremily wont sellamount look like deal might point
bob step offersnow two people willing pay 
sack potato cathy bob one person dan
willing sell forcathy notice doesnt want losegood deal offer danfor potato emily also
offer sell forso two buyer two sellerprice note could settled price betweenand
bartering stop fred alice well
fred alice willing trade since alicewilling payand fred sell amountalice cant outbid cathy bob purchase dan alice
able get trade fred cant underbid danemily able get trade cathyword stable equilibrium reached
graph discrete example

supply demand graph could also drawn demand

history supply demand

attempt determine supply demand interact began adam
smith wealth nation first published inin book
mostly assumed supply price fixed demand
would increase decrease price decreased increased david
ricardo inpublished book principle political economytaxation first idea economic model proposedrigorously laid idea assumptionused build idea supply demand

late century marginalist school thought emerged
field mainly started stanley jevons carl menger lon
walras key idea price set expensive
price price margin substantial change
adam smith thought determining supply price

finally basic modern school theory supplydemand finalized alfred marshall lon walrascombined idea supply idea demand began
looking equilibrium point two curve crossedalso began looking effect market sincelate century theory supply demand mainlyunchanged work examining exceptionmodel like oligarchy transaction cost nonrationality

criticism marshall theory supply demand

marshall theory supply demand run counter ideaeconomist adam smith david ricardo creationmarginalist school thought although marshall theorydominant university today economist disagreedone theory counter marshall price already knowncommodity reach market negating ideaabstract market conveying price information thingmarket communicates whether object exchangeablecase would change object commoditywould mean producer creates good without alreadycustomersblindly producing hoping someone buy buy
meaning exchange money commodity modern producer often
market study prepared well advance production decisions
however misallocation factor production still occur

keynesian economics also run counter theory supplydemand keynesian theory price become sticky resistantchange especially case price decrease leadmarket failure modern supporter keynes paul krugmannoted recent history boston housing market
dried early neither buyer seller willingexchange price equilibrium

gregory mankiws work irrationality actor markets
also undermines marshall simplistic view force involvedsupply demand

empirical estimation
