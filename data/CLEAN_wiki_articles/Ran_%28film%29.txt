themes

chaos

terrible scroll hell shown depicting fallcastle real sound scroll unfolds likedaytime nightmare scene human evildoing waydemonic ashura seen buddha tear music
superimposed picture like buddha heart
measured beat profound anguish chanting melody
full sorrow begin like sobbing rise graduallyrepeated like karmic cycle finally sound likewailing countless buddhas
ran screenplay

title suggests chaos occurs repeatedly film many
scene kurosawa foreshadows filming approaching cumulonimbus
cloud finally break raging storm castle
massacre hidetora autocrat whose powerful presence keepcountryside unified peace abdication freecharacter like jiro lady kaede pursue agendas
absolute ruthlessness title almost
certainly allusion hidetoras decision abdicateresulting mayhem follows exampledisorder life michael sragow call trickledown theoryanarchy kuroganes assassination taro ultimately elevates lady
kaede power turn unwilling pawn schemes
saburos decision rescue hidetora ultimately draw two rival
warlord lead unwanted battle jiro saburo
culminating destruction ichimonji clan

ultimate example chaos absence god hidetora sees
lady devout buddhist religious characterfilm tell buddha gone miserable world
su despite belief love forgiveness eventually hahead cut kyoami claim god either dont existcause human suffering tango responds god cant
save kurosawa repeated point sayinghumanity must face life without relying god buddha last
shot film show tsurumaru standing top ruinfamily castle unable see stumble towards edgealmost fall drop scroll buddha sistergiven stand blind man edgeprecipice bereft god darkening world may symbolize
modern concept death god kurosawa also claimedman perfectly alone tsurumaru represents modern humanity

nihilism

akira kurosawa

addition chaotic element ran also contains strong element
nihilism present opening sequence hidetora
mercilessly hunt boar last scene tsurumaru roger
ebert describes ran century film set medieval timeold man arrive end lifebattle foolishly think still power settle things
new generation life hurry ahead without respecthistorical continuity child lust furies
irrelevant divide spoil like dogs
tearing carcass

marked radical departure kurosawa earlier film manyfilled hope redemption even kagemusha thoughchronicled destruction samurai class ended noteregret rather despair contrast world ranhobbesian world life endless cycle sufferingeverybody villain victim many case hero like
saburo may right thing end doomed well
unlike kurosawa hero like kikuchiyo seven samuraiwatanabe ikiru die performing great act saburo dies
pointlessly conniving character like jiro lady kaede never
given chance atone predestined life wickednessultimately violent death well

warfare

technological progress last year hataught human kill fasterdifficult retain sanguine outlook lifecircumstances
akira kurosawa

according michael wilmington kurosawa told muchfilm metaphor nuclear warfare anxietyposthiroshima age believed despite technological
progress century people learned kill
efficiently ran vehicle apocalyptic
destruction arquebus early firearm introducedjapan arquebus revolutionized samurai warfareage sword single combat warrior fell rapidly wayside
samurai warfare would characterized massive faceless armies

battle hachiman field perfect illustration new kind
warfare saburos arquebusers annihilate jiros cavalry drive

kurosawa also illustrates new warfare camera insteadfocusing warring army frequently set focal plane
