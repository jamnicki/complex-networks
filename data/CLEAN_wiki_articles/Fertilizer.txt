spreading manure organic fertilizer

fertilizer british english also fertiliser compound givenplant promote growth usually applied either via soil
uptake plant root foliar feeding uptakeleaf fertilizer organic composed organic matter carbon based inorganic containing simple inorganic chemicals
naturallyoccurring compound peat mineral
deposit manufactured natural processcomposting chemical process haber process

fertilizer typically provide varying proportion three major
plant nutrient nitrogen phosphorus potassium secondary
plant nutrient calcium sulfur magnesium sometimes trace
element micronutrient role plant nutrition boron
chlorine manganese iron zinc copper molybdenum

inorganic fertilizer mineral fertilizer

example naturallyoccurring inorganic fertilizer include
chilean sodium nitrate mined rock phosphate limestonecalcium source mostly used reduce soil acidity
example manufactured chemicallysynthesized inorganic
fertilizer include ammonium nitrate potassium sulfatesuperphosphate triple superphosphate

agricultural versus horticultural fertilizers

general agricultural fertilizer contain one two
macronutrients agricultural fertilizer intended applied
infrequently normally prior along side seeding exampleagricultural fertilizer granular triple superphosphate potassium
chloride urea anhydrous ammonia commodity naturefertilizer combined high cost shipping lead uselocally available material closestcheapest source
may vary factor affecting transportation rail shiptruck word particular nitrogen source may popular
one part country another popular another
geographic region due factor unrelated agronomic concerns

horticultural specialty fertilizer handformulated many compound others produce
wellbalanced fertilizer also contain micronutrientmaterial ammonium nitrate used minimally large scale
production farming theexample horticultural
fertilizer formulated high phosphorus promote bloom development
ornamental flower horticultural fertilizer may watersoluble
instant release relatively insoluble controlled release
controlled release fertilizer also referred sustained
release timed release many controlled release fertilizerintended applied approximately everymonths dependingwatering growth rate condition whereas watersoluble
fertilizer must applied least everyweeks applied
often every watering sufficiently dilute unlike agricultural
fertilizer horticultural fertilizer marketed directlyconsumer become part retail product distribution lines

organic fertilizers

example naturally occurring organic fertilizer include manure
slurry worm casting peat seaweed guano green manure crops
also grown add nutrient soil naturally occurring
mineral mine rock phosphate sulfate potashlimestone also considered organic fertilizers
example manufactured organic fertilizer include compost
bloodmeal bone meal seaweed extract examplenatural enzyme digested protein fish meal feather meal

decomposing crop residue prior year another sourcefertility though strictly considered fertilizer distinction
seems matter word reality

ambiguity usage term organic existssynthetic fertilizer urea urea formaldehyde fully
organic sense organic chemistry fact woulddifficult chemically distinguish urea biological origin
produced synthetically hand fertilizer
material commonly approved organic agriculture powdered
limestone mined rock phosphate chilean saltpeter inorganic
use term chemistry

although density nutrient organic material comparatively
modest advantage one thing organic growers
typically produce fertilizer onsite thus
lowering operating cost considerably mattereffective promoting plant growth chemical soil test
result aside answer encouraging since majoritynitrogen supplying organic fertilizer contain insoluble nitrogenslow release fertilizer effectiveness greaterconventional nitrogen fertilzers

implicit modern theory organic agriculture ideapendulum swung way extent thinking plant
nutrition admitting obvious success leibigs theorystress serious limitation current methodimplementing via chemical fertilization reemphasize role
humus organic component soil believedplay several important roles
mobilizing existing soil nutrient good growth achieved
lower nutrient density wasting less
releasing nutrient slower consistent rate helpingavoid boomandbust pattern
helping retain soil moisture reducing stress duetemporary moisture stress
improving soil structure

organic also advantage avoiding certain longterm problems
associated regular heavy use artificial fertilizers
possibility burning plant concentrated chemicals
ie supply nutrients
progressive decrease real perceived soil health
apparent loss structure reduced ability absorb
precipitation lightening soil colour etc
necessity reapplying artificial fertilizer regularlyperhaps increasing quantity maintain fertility
cost substantial rising recent year resulting
lack independence
