naive set theory

beginning work beitrge zur begrndung der transfiniten
mengenlehre georg cantor principal creator set theory made
following definition set

set understand collection definite distinct objects
perception thought calledelement whole

object set also called member element set
anything number people letter alphabet sets
set conventionally denoted capital letterinstance c two set said equal every
member also member crucially every member balso member written 
set unlike multiset cannot contain two identical
element set operation preserve property elementset unique similarly order element set
listed irrelevant unlike sequence tuple

axiomatic set theory

although initially naive set theory defines set merelywelldefined collection well accepted soon ranseveral obstacle found definition spawned several
paradox notably
russels paradoxit show set setcontain set leftx xmbox set
xnotin rightis welldefined
cantor paradoxit show set set cannot
exist

reason phrase welldefined welldefinedwa important free set theory paradox since entire
mathematics redefined term set theory attempt
avoid paradox set theory axiomatized basedfirstorder logic thus axiomatic set theory born

purpose however naive set theory still useful

applications

description set

set precise description may arbitrary
collection expressible inclusion criteria

set may described words

set whose member first four positive whole
numbers
b set whose member color french flag

convention set defined explicitly listing elements
brace sometimes called curly bracket curly braces

c
dred white blue

two different description may define set usingexample identical since preciselymember shorthand used express equality

set described set builder notation doe depend order
element listed whether repetitions
list example



notationmerely indicates set
described includes element listed element listed
two element transposed effect
resulting set

set many element abbreviated list sometimes used
first one thousand positive whole number described using
symbolic shorthand



ellipsisindicates list continues way
ellipsis may also used set extend infinity setpositive even number described

set particularly complex one use different notationset whose member first twenty number four less
square integer described

fnn integer andn
