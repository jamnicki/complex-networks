classic microscope whole optical assembly attached
rigid arm turn attached robust shaped footprovide necessary rigidity arm usually able pivotjoint foot allow viewing angle adjusted mounted
arm control focusing usually placed typically large
knurled wheel control coarse focusing together smaller
knurled wheel control fine focusing

modern microscope may many feature including
transmissionreflection illumination filter apparatus phase
contrast microscopy differential interference microscopy digital
