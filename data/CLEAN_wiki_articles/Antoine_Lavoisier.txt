aftermath

lavoisier fundamental contribution chemistry resultconscious effort fit experiment framework single
theory established consistent use chemical balance used
oxygen overthrow phlogiston theory developed new system
chemical nomenclature held oxygen essential
constituent acid later turned erroneous
lavoisier also made introductory research physical chemistrythermodynamics joint experiment laplace usedcalorimeter estimate heat evolved per unit carbon dioxide
produced eventually found ratio flame animals
indicating animal produced energy type combustion
constant pressure calorimeter made lavoisier chemical enthalpy

also made remarkable contribution chemical bonding stating
radical theory believing radical function single
group chemical reaction would combine oxygen reactions
also introduced possibility allotropy chemical elements
discovered diamond crystalline form carbon

also updated many chemical concept first time modern
notion element laid systematically three four
element classical chemistry gave way modern systemlavoisier worked reaction chemical equation respectconservation mass see example nitrogen cycle
