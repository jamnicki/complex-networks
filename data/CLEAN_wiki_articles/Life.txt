 school wikipedia selection related subject general biology

life characteristic state organism individual cells
property common known organism found earth plants
animal fungi protist archaea bacteriacarbonand waterbased cellular complex organization
undergo metabolism posse capacity grow respond stimuli
reproduce natural selection adapt succeeding
generations

entity property considered organism
however every definition life considers properties
essential example capacity descentmodification often taken essential property life
definition notably includes virus qualifynarrower definition acellular metabolise
broader definition life may also include theoretical
noncarbonbased life alternative biology

although cannot pinpointed exactly evidence suggests life
earth existed aboutbillion yearscurrently entire
earth contains aboutbillion ton biomass life lives
within various environment within biosphere

definition opinion

life set process carried organism
causing survive

conventional definition

although universal agreement definition life
scientist generally accept biological manifestation life
exhibit following phenomena
homeostasis regulation internal environment maintainconstant state example sweating coolorganization composed one cellbasic unit life
metabolism production energy converting nonliving material
cellular componentssynthesis decomposing organic

reaction involving sens higher animal responseoften expressed motion example leaf plant
turning toward sun animal chasing prey
reproduction ability produce new organism reproduction
division one cell form two new cell usuallyterm applied production new individual either
asexually single parent organism sexuallyleast two differing parent organism although strictly speaking
also describes production new cell processgrowth

exception conventional definition

important note life definition applies
primarily level specie even though many individualgiven specie reproduce possibly belongspecialized sterile caste ant worker still
considered form life one could say property lifeinherited hence sterile hybrid specie muleconsidered life although capable reproductionalso worth noting nonreproducing individual may still helpspread gene mechanism kin selection

similar reason virus aberrant prion protein often
considered replicators rather form life distinction
warranted cannot reproduce without specialized
substrate host cell protein respectively howeverform life rely food produced specie leastspecific chemistry earth environment

individual contest definition life philosophical
ground offer following example life virusreproduce storm flame grow certain computer software
program programmed mutate evolve future software
program may evince even highorder behaviour machinemove form protolife consisting metabolizing cells
without ability reproduce

still scientist would call phenomenon expressivelife generally seven characteristic required population
considered life form

descent modification

useful characteristic upon base definition lifedescent modification ability life form produce
offspring like parent parent possibility
variation due chance descent modificationsufficient allow evolution assuming variations
offspring allow differential survival studyform heritability called genetics known life forms
assuming prion counted genetic materialprimarily dna related molecule rna

unlike definition definition life includes virusreplicators genotype phenotype making capable
natural selection evolution definition may also include
replicating element including plasmid otherwise
considered part larger organism

also difficult definition organism cannot reproduce
directly worker beeswhich may also continue geneline
helping produce sibling sterilised organismspayed neutered pet longer capable descent

abstract concept may also considered alive definition
including meme artificial life computer softwareselfmodifying computer virus program created genetic
programming

definitions

systemic definition living thing selforganizingautopoietic selfproducing object confuseddissipative structure fire

variation definition include stuart kauffmans definitionlife autonomous agent multiagent system capablereproducing completing least one
thermodynamic work cycle

another definition living thing system tend respond
change environment inside way
promote continuation

yet another definition life selforganizing cannibalistic
system consisting population replicators capablemutation around homeostatic metabolizing organisms
evolve definition doe include flame doe include
worker ant virus mule without doe include
viruses

self reproduction energy consumption one mean system
promote continuation explains bee alive
yet commit suicide defending hive case whole
colony work living system

origin life

truly standard model origin lifecurrently accepted scientific model build one way anotherfollowing discovery listed roughly order postulated

possibility extraterrestrial life

earth planet universe known harbour lifedrake equation used estimate probability life
elsewhere scientist disagree many value variables
equation depending value equation may either
suggest life arises frequently infrequently
