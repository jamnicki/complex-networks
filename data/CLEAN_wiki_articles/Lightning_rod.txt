construction uses

lightning rod connected via lowresistance wire cableearth water charge may safely dissipated
lightning rod sometimes posse short circuit groundinterrupted thin non conductor lightning jumps
ideally underground part assembly reside muddy
area area tends become stormunderground cable resist corrosion well may covered salt

wooden church lightning rod grounding cables

lightning damage humanity since people started building
structure early structure made wood stone tended short
valley result lightning hit rarely buildings
became taller lightning became significant threat lightningdamage structure made material masonry wood concreteeven steel huge current involved heat materialespecially water high temperature causing fire loss strength
explosion superheated steam air

united states

united state pointed lightning rod conductoraccurately lightning attractor invented benjamin franklin
part groundbreaking exploration electricity franklin
speculated iron rod sharpened point end

electrical fire would think drawn cloud
silently could come near enough strike 

franklin speculated lightning rod several yearreported kite experiment

th century lightning rod became symbol american
ingenuity decorative motif lightning rod often embellished
ornamental glass ball prized collector also served

ball solid glass occasionally used method purportedprevent lightning strike ship worth notingworked didnt reveals lotprescientific thought basic principle glass objects
nonconductor seldom struck lightning therefore goes
theory must something glass repels lightning
hence best method preventing lightning strike wooden
ship bury small solid glass ball tip highest
mast random behaviour lightning ensured method gained
good bit credence even development marine
lightning rod soon franklin initial work

lightning prevention

lightning rod dissipaters known early streamer emission
dissipation array system charge transfer system claim makestructure attractive lightning generally encompass
system equipment preventative protection objects
located surface earth effect atmospherics
scientist claim device nothing expensive
lightning rod unlike traditional method based
scientifically proven indisputable technical argumentunderlying theory scientific nonsense

controversy date back franklin stated
lightning rod protected building dissipating electric
charge later retracted statement disclaimer statingexact mode operation device something mysterypoint

thus began year dispute dissipation theorydiversion theory lightning protection

dissipation theory state lightning strike structure

diversion theory state lightning rod protects building
purely grounded thus lightning stroke happens
attach rod diverted around structureearth ground cable uncertaintylightning strike might preferentially attach lightning rodleading assumption air near rod becomes ionizedthus conductive due intense electric field

close reading scant scientific literature subjectreveal much problem thus far proven
impossible conduct controlled experiment natural lightningtest structure equipped lightning instrumentation may
languish year without strike subjected strike
destroys instrumentation

moreover lightning strike metallic structure frequently leaves
evidence excepting perhaps small pit metal meanstrike uninstrumented structure must visually confirmed
random behaviour lightning render observations

thus strip away two century legal action political
activity general outrage exhibited side findcurrent state dissipationdiversion controversy drawneither theory proven essentially data

research situation improving somewhat however controlled
experiment may far future good data obtained
technique use network radio receiver watch
characteristic electrical signature lightning strikes
using fixed directional antenna accurate timingtriangulation technique lightning strike located great
precision strike specific object often confirmed
