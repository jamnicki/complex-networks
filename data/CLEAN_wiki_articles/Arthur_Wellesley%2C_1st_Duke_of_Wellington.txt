despite frequently cited similarity napoleon bonapartewellington strategy tactic employeddiametrically opposed perhaps main reason napoleon standmany history text wellington napoleon offered radical
change warfare every respect whereas wellington contribution
warfare lay brilliant use old ways

napoleon tactic typified massive conscript armyadvanced tight column rout opposing force tactic
originated frederick great soon adopted nearly
every major participant war chief exceptionbritish portuguese spanish troop trained almost
every engagement tightpacked french columnfirst two rank outer edge could fire would advance apparently
unheeding casualty illtrained panicprone armies
austrian allied power spectacularly
successful disciplined trained british regularstood line two rank thus permitting every man line fire
column dramatic failure despite demonstrated
helplessness french column british line french
commander iberia continued attack column indeed column
attack used even battle waterloo thus many
instance single british battalion would defeat entire french
division

wellington often viewed defensive general despite fact
many greatest victoriesassaye porto salamanca
vitoria toulouse offensive battle factdefensive wellington actually made mistake famouslybattle fuentes ooro disastrous misplacementdivision retrieved quick thinking steadinessbritish portuguese troop retreating fire

strategically wellington also appears somewhat anachronisticpeninsular war revolving partly around possession besiegingfortified stronghold conventional military wisdom era
especially napoleon dictated opposing field army waeliminated price disease wastage could reduceattacking force nothing pursuit aim desperate measures
would taken winter battle forced march privation
alleviated foraging wellington campaign instead marked
carefully planned offensive supported magnificent supply
train tempered subsequent consolidation gains

strategic area however wellington seemed foresee tide
future construction fortification near torres
vedras subsequent attritional campaign ensued seemstypify evolution warfare following century also
cooperated closely british navy necessity successwaterbound iberian peninsula

tactically wellington capitalized reform sir john mooreduke york creating large unit independent infantry often
armed rifle fought regular irregular fashion
relationship cavalry armas well cavalry
commanderswas infamously stern demanding wellington never
satisfied performance cavalry continuedconsider undisciplined charge stating

trick officer acquired galloping everything
galloping back fast galloped enemynever consider situation never think manoeuvringenemyso little one would think cannot manoeuvre except

however wellington commander henry paget marquessanglesey john gaspard marchant made cavalry arm amongeffective army producing decisive result assaye
salamanca waterloo latter saw earl uxbridges usetwo cavalry brigade rout entire french corp thoughcavalry lack discipline immediately magnificent charge
destroyed effectiveness rest day

wellington also considered model multinational
leadership efficiently coordinated effort portuguese
spanish multitude foreign unit well negotiating
home government always sympathetic military concerns
testament wellington ability successfully
integrated commanded british spanish portuguese hanoverian
saxon prussian swiss indian dutch belgian troop retinue
