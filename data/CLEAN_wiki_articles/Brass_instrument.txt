brass instrument musical instrument whose tone producedvibration lip player blow tubular resonator
mouthpiece also called labrosones literally meaning
lipvibrated instrument baines 

effectively change pitch valved brass instrument two things
come play pressing valve effectively change length

family brass instruments

modern brass instrument generally come one two families
valved brass instrument use set valve typicallyorbut
many asor case operated players
finger introduce additional tubing instrument
changing overall length family includes modern
brass instrument except trombone trumpet horn
euphonium tuba well cornet flgelhorn baritone
horn sousaphone mellophone old saxhorn valved
instrument predominant among brass todaythorough discussion working foundvalve usually piston valve rotary valve rotary
valve norm horn also prevalenttuba

slide brass instrument use slide change length tubing
main instrument category trombone family
though valve trombone occasionally used especially jazz
trombone family ancestor sackbut folk instrument
bazooka also slide family

two family become functionally obsolete

additional tubing thus lengthening instrument lowering
harmonic series instrument vibratingpossible though rare behaviour reversed iepressing valve remove length tubing rather adding one
additional tubing usually feature short tuning slidefine adjustment valve tuning except short
make practicable

two major type valve rotary valve piston valvefirst piston valve instrument developed startth century stlzel valve invented heinrich stlzelwa early variety mid century vienna valve
wa improved design however professional musician preferred
rotary valve quicker reliable action better designs
piston valve mass manufactured towards end century since early decade century piston valves

correct problem manufacturer low brass instruments
may choose one combination four basic approach whose
respective merit subject debate

compensation system

compensation system first two three valveadditional set tubing extending back valvethird fourth valve depressed combination another
one air routed usual set tubing plusextra one pitch lowered appropriate amountallows compensating instrument play accurate intonationoctave open second partial critical tubaeuphonium much repertoire

compensating system applied french horn servedifferent purpose used allow double horn b flat
ease playing difficulty high register contrastsystem use tuba euphonium default side horn
longer horn secondary length tubing comingplay first second third valve pressed pressingthumb valve take secondary valve slide extra lengthmain tubing play produce shorter bflat horn later full
double design completely separate valve section tubing two
side considered superior although rather heavier weight

additional valves

initially compensated instrument tended sound stuffy blow less
freely due air doubled back main valveearly design led sharp bend tubingobstruction airflow manufacturer therefore preferred
adding straight valve instead example couldpitched little lower st valve intendedused instead respective valve combinationlonger featured euphonium decade professional tuba still
built like five valve norm bbtubas
five six valve ftubas

compensating double french horn also suffer stuffiness
resulting air passed valve section twice
really affect longer side compensating
double useful rd horn player f
side less

additional set slide valve

another approach addition two set slide different
part range used euphonium tuba built like
today approach become highly exoticinstrumentsexcept french horn norm usuallydouble sometimes even triple configuration

trigger mechanism

mechanical lever provided pull main tuning slidevalve slide mechanism used aid intonation notenaturally tune specific register instrumentallows speedy adjustment whilst playing sprung way
return original position operationexample instrument utilize trigger
cornet

trigger often found first third valve used
adjust lower g particular along higher
f due mechanic trigger often get
stuck throw similar trigger without springpreferred

trumpet

augmented length failure mechanism common

euphoniums

sound production brass instruments

player brass instrument direct controlprime vibrator lip brass instrument exploit players
ability select harmonic instrument column air
vibrate making instrument twice longequivalent woodwind instrument starting second harmonic
player get good range note simply varying tensionlip see embouchure brass player call harmonicpartial cause part tubing vibrate
whereas fundamental entire tubing vibrate

brass instrument fitted removable mouthpiece
different shape size style mouthpiece may used suit
different embouchure easily produce certain tonal
characteristic trumpet characteristically fitted cupped
mouthpiece horn fitted conical mouthpiece

one interesting difference woodwind instrument brass
instrument woodwind instrument nondirectional means
sound produced propagates direction approximately
equal volume brass instrument hand highly
directional sound produced traveling straight outward
bell difference make significantly difficultrecord woodwind instrument accurately also play major roleperformance situation marching bands

materials

brass instrument normally made brass polishedlacquered prevent corrosion quality instrument use gold
plating prevent corrosion

also constructed alloy containing
significant amount copper silver alloy biostatic
oligodynamic effect thus suppress growth molds
fungi bacteria horn constructed stainless steel aluminium
sound bad rapidly colonized microorganismbecome unpleasant play

quality instrument designed prevent reduce galvanic
corrosion steel valve spring brasstubing design may take form desiccant design keep
valve dry sacrificial zinc replaceable valve core springs
plastic insulating washer nonconductive noble materialvalve core spring instrument use several features

didactics

child may start learn brass instrument soonpermanent teeth arrived usually ageit possiblestart earlier teeth still changing embouchure
need occasional adjustment pressure lip teeth may
undesirable effects
