science broadest sense refers system objective
knowledge restricted sense science refers systemacquiring knowledge based scientific method wellorganized body knowledge human gained research

different point view regarding scientific method
methodological naturalism maintains scientific investigation must
adhere empirical study independent verification processproperly developing evaluating natural explanation observable
phenomenon methodological naturalism typically therefore rejects
supernatural explanation argument authority biased
observational study critical rationalism instead hold unbiased
observation possible demarcation naturalsupernatural explanation arbitrary instead proposes
falsifiability landmark scientific theory falsification
universal scientific method approach generalized
pancritical rationalism instrumentalism reject concepttruth emphasizes merely utility theory instrumentexplaining predicting phenomena

field science commonly classified along two major lines
natural science study natural phenomena
social science study human behaviour societies

etymology

schizein split latin scindere split middle ageenlightenment science scientia meant systematic exact
recorded knowledge science therefore sort broad
meaning philosophy time language including

science versus science plural term often useddifficult distinguish usage without referring complex
etymology like therefore might helpful distinguish
science generally relating whole body knowledgeseparated way discipline subjectgenerally reference meaning without regard time

classical time advent modern era philosophydivided natural philosophy moral philosophyterm natural philosophy gradually gave way term natural science
natural science gradually specialized current domaintypically includes physical science biological sciencesocial science inheriting portion realm moral philosophy
currently also included auspex science extent

moral philosophy still retains study ethic regardedbranch philosophy one three classical normative sciences

scientific method

scientist use model refer description something
specifically one used make predictiontested experiment observation hypothesis contentionha neither well supported yet ruled experimenttheory context science logically selfconsistent model
framework describing behavior certain natural
phenomenon theory typically describes behaviour much broader
set phenomenon hypothesiscommonly large numberhypothesis may logically bound together single theoryphysical law law nature scientific generalization basedsufficiently large number empirical observation takenfully verified

scientific method seek explain complexity naturecommon known easily replicated way use explanations
make useful prediction scientific method provides objective
process find solution problem number scientifictechnological field often scientist preference one
outcome another important preference doebias interpretation scientific method attempt minimize
influence scientist bias outcome experiment
achieved correct experimental design thorough peer
review experimental design well conclusion study

scientist never claim absolute knowledge unlike mathematical proof
proven scientific theory always open falsification new
evidence presented even basic fundamental theory may
turn imperfect new observation inconsistentcritical process making every relevant aspectresearch publicly available permit peer review published
result also allows ongoing review repeating experiments
observation multiple researcher operating independently one
another fulfilling expectation determinedreliable experimental result potential use others
