alternation called isomorphic second formdifferent appearance alternation called heteromorphic terms
applied kind life cycle diplobiontic diplohaplontic
haplodiplontic dibiontic

heterogamy term used describe alternation parthenogenic
sexually reproductive phase occurs animal although
conceptually similar alternation generation geneticsheterogamy significantly different

fungi

fungal mycelium typically haploid mycelium different mating
type meet produce two multinucleate ballshaped celljoin via mating bridge nucleus move one myceliumforming heterokaryon meaning different nucleusprocess called plasmogamy actual fusion form diploid nucleuscalled karyogamy may occur sporangium formed
karogamy produce diploid zygote shortlived sporophyte
soon undergoes meiosis form haploid spore spores
germinate develop new mycelia

protists

protist undergo alternation generation includingslime mold foraminifera many marine algae

life cycle slime mold similar fungi haploid
spore germinate form swarm cell myxamoebae fuseprocess referred plasmogamy karyogamy form diploid
zygote zygote develops plasmodium mature
plasmodium produce depending specie one many fruiting
body containing haploid spores

foraminifera undergo heteromorphic alternation generationhaploid gamont diploid agamont phase singlecelled
haploid organism typically much larger diploid organism

alternation generation occurs almost marine algaered algae many green algae brown algae phaseisomorphic freeliving specie red algae complex
triphasic alternation generation kelp example brown
alga heteromorphic alternation generation speciegenus laminaria large sporophytic thallus produce haploid
spore germinate produce freeliving microscopic malefemale gametophytes
