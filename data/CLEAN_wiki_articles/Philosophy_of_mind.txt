philosophy mind philosophical study naturemind mental event mental function mental propertyconsciousness nature relationshipphysical body socalled mindbody problem

dualism monism two major school thought attemptresolve mindbody problem dualism asserts separate existence
mind body traced back plato aristotlewest sankhya school hindu philosophy eastprecisely formulated modern term ren descartes century monism first proposed west parmenides modern
time baruch spinoza maintains one substanceeast rough parallel might hindu concept brahmantao lao tzu

substance dualist argue mind independently existing
substance property dualist maintain mind jumble

materialism physicalism including behaviorism identity

modern philosopher mind adopt either reductivenonreductive physicalist position maintaining different ways
brain exists reductivists assert mental states
property eventually explained neuroscientific accounts
brain process statesnonreductionists argue though
brain predicate vocabulary used mental
description explanation indispensable cannot reduced

argument dualism

main argument favour dualism simply appealcommonsense intuition vast majoritynonphilosophicallytrained people asked mindaverage person usually respond identifying self
personality soul entityalmost certainly deny mind simply brain viceversa
finding idea one ontological entity playmechanistic simply unintelligible majority modern
philosopher mind reject dualism suggesting intuitions
like many others probably misleading use critical
faculty well empirical evidence science examine
assumption determine real basis
another important modern argument favour dualismidea mental physical seem quite different
perhaps irreconcilable property mental event certain
subjective quality whereas physical event obviouslyexample doe burned finger feel like doe blue sky
look like doe nice music sound like philosopher mind call
subjective aspect mental event qualia raw feelsomething like feel pain see familiar shadeblue qualia involved mental eventclaim qualia seem particularly difficult reduceanything physical

nonreductive physicalism

many philosopher hold firmly two essential conviction regard
mindbody relations

physicalism true mental state must physical states

reductionist proposal unsatisfactory mental state cannot
reduced behaviour brain state functional states

hence question arises whether still nonreductive
physicalism donald davidsons anomalous monism attemptformulate physicalism

idea often formulated term thesis supervenience
mental state supervene physical state reduciblesupervenience therefore describes functional dependence
change mental without changephysical

naturalism problems

thesis physicalism mind part materialphysical world position face fundamental problemmind certain property material thing possesses
physicalism must therefore explain possibleproperty emerge material thing nevertheless project

naturalization mental crucial problemproject must attempt resolve wellknown probablyfollowing two

qualia

many mental state property experienced subjectively
different way different individual exampleobviously characteristic mental state pain hurts
moreover sensation pain may identical mine since
way measuring much something hurt describing
exactly feel hurt doe experience quale
come nothing indicates neural functional stateaccompanied pain experience often point formulatedfollows existence cerebral event cannot
explain accompanied corresponding qualitative
experience many cerebral process occur accompanying
experiential aspect consciousness seems impossible explain

yet also seems many science eventually explain
