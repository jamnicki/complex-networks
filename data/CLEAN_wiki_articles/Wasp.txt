reproduction wasps

generally wasp mating flight instead reproduce
single queen male drone vicinitynesting area successfully mating drone sperm cellstored tightly packed ball inside queen sperm kept
stored dormant state following spring certain time
year often around autumn time bulk wasp colony dies
away leaving young mated queen alive timeleave nest find suitable area hibernate winter

emerging hibernation early spring young queens
search suitable nesting site upon finding area future
colony queen usually construct basic paper nestbegin lay egg varies specie speciespecific wasp live paper nests

sperm stored earlier kept dormant winterused fertilize egg laid storage sperm insidefemale queen allows lay considerable number fertilized eggs
without need repeated mating male wasp reason
single female queen quite capable building entire colony
egg laid initially sterile female workers
begin construct elaborate nest around queen
take role feeding larvae

wasp sex significantly genetically different femalediploid number chromosome come fertilized eggs
male contrast haploid number chromosomedevelop unfertilised egg

towards end summer female wasp begin runstored sperm fertilize egg egg develop fertile
male fertile female queen male drone flynest find mate thus perpetuating wasp reproductive cyclequeen leave colony hibernate winterwasp begin die successfully mating young
