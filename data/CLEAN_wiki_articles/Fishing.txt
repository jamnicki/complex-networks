electrofishing

relatively new fishing technique electrofishing typically used
stream classification survey catching brood stockhatchery making estimate population body watergated pulse direct current used cause muscular contractionfish called galvanotaxis causing turn towards sourceelectrical current swim towards correct pulse speeds
duration used along correct current

low voltage short pulse long gap cause fish swim

cause galvanonarcosis unconsciousness technique setting
pulse length pattern current voltage require great skillfish effectively without killing injuring fishleft unharmed dissolved mineral water decrease resistance
causing current pas fish whereas fish
