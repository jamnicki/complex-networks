operation procedures

surgical procedure phacoemulsification removal cataract
involves number step order starting proper anaesthesia
exposure using lid speculum incision corneal scleral
viscoelastic injection stabilise anterior chamber capsulotomy
hydrodissection hydrodelineation ultrasonic emulsification nuclear
cracking chopping needed cortical aspiration capsular
polishing needed implantationcentration iol viscoelastic
removal wound closurehydration needed

pupil dilated using drop iol placed behindiris help better visualise cataract pupil constricting drops
reserved secondary implantation iol frontirisif cataract already removed without primary iol
implantation anesthesia may placed topically eyedrop via
injection next peribulbar behind retrobulbar eye oralintravenous sedation may also used reduce anxiety general
anesthesia rarely necessary may employed childadult particular medical psychiatric issue operation may
occur stretcher reclining examination chair eyelids
surrounding skin swabbed disinfectant facecovered cloth sheet opening operative eye
eyelid held open speculum minimize blinkingsurgery pain usually minimal properly anesthetised eye though
pressure sensation discomfort bright operating
microscope light common ocular surface kept moist using
sterile saline eyedrop incision fashioned nearcornea sclera meet corneoscleral junction adavantages smaller
incision include use stitch shortened recovery time
capsulotomy capsulorhexis rarely known cystitomyprocedure open portion lens capsule anterior
