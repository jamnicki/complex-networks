kimberlite pipes

kimberlite pipe eruption ejects column overlying material
directly magma column doe form large aboveground
elevation typical volcano instead low ring ejecta known
tuff ring form around bowlshaped depressionsubterranean column magma time tuff ring may erode back
bowl leveling depression fillingwashedback ejecta

lamproite pipes

lamproite pipe operate similarly kimberlite pipe exceptboiling water volatile compound contained magma act
corrosively overlying rock resulting broader coneeviscerated rock ejection rock also form tuff ring
like kimberlite eruption broad cone filledvolcanic ash material finally degassed magma pushed
upward filling cone result martiniglass shaped deposit
volcanic material solidified magma ejecta appears
mostly flat surface
