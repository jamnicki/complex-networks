system scientific classification widely usedbiological sciences

linnaean system classified nature within hierarchy startingthree kingdom kingdom divided class turn
order divided genus singular genusdivided specie singular specie rankspecie sometimes recognized taxon lower unnamed rankplant called varieties

grouping based upon shared physical characteristic although
grouping animal remain day groupings
significantly changed since linnaeus conception
well principle behind credited establishing
idea hierarchical structure classification based
upon observable characteristic underlying details
concerning considered scientifically valid observable
characteristic changed expanding knowledge example dna

classification


linnaeus scientifical research took science path diverged
taught religious authority lutheran
archbishop uppsala accused impiety letterjohann georg gmelin dated februarylinnaeus wrote
original latin

non placet quod hominem inter anthropomorpha collocaverim sed homo
noscit ipsum removeamus vocabula mihi perinde erit quo nomine
utamur sed quaero et toto orbe differentiam genericam inter
hominem simiam quae principiis historiae naturalis ego
certissime nullam novi utinam aliquis mihi unicam diceret vocassem
hominem simiam vel vice versa omnes conjecissem theologos
debuissem forte lege artis
english translation

pleasing must place human among primates
man intimately familiar let quibbleword whatever name applieddesperately seek whole world general difference
men simian principle natural historycertainly know none someone might tell one called
man simian vice versa would bring together theologians
perhaps ought accordance lawdiscipline natural history
