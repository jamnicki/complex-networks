heinz dilemma

dilemma kohlberg used original research wadruggist dilemma heinz steal drug europe

woman near death special kind cancer one
drug doctor thought might save formradium druggist town recently discovereddrug expensive make druggist charging ten times
drug cost produce paidfor radiumchargedfor small dose drug sick womans
husband heinz went everyone knew borrow moneycould get together aboutwhich half cost
told druggist wife dying asked sell
cheaper let pay later druggist saiddiscovered drug going make money heinz
got desperate broke man store steal drugfor
wife
heinz broken laboratory steal drugwife
theoretical point view importantparticipant think heinz kohlbergs theory holdjustification participant offer significantform response many example possible
argument belong six stages

stage one obedience heinz steal medicineconsequently put prison mean really terrible
heinz steal medicine worthandmuch druggist wanted heinz even offered paywa stealing anything else besides

stage two selfinterest heinz steal medicinemuch happier save wife evenserve prison sentence heinz steal medicine
prison awful place would probably languishjail cell wife death

stage three conformity heinz steal medicinewife expects want good husband heinzsteal drug stealing bad criminaltried everything could without breaking law cannot
blame
stage four lawandorder heinz steal medicinelaw prohibits stealing making illegal heinz steal
drug wife also take prescribed punishmentcrime well paying druggist owed criminal cannot
run around without regard law action consequences

stage five human right heinz steal medicineeveryone right choose life regardless law heinz
steal medicine scientist right fair
compensation even wife sick doe make actions
right

stage six universal human ethic heinz steal medicine
saving human life fundamental valueproperty right another person heinz stealmedicine others may need medicine badlylife equally significant
