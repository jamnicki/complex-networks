heredity variation form basis genetics human applied
knowledge genetics prehistory domestication breeding
plant animal modern research genetics provides important
tool investigation function particular gene analysis genetic interaction within organism genetic information
generally carried chromosome representedchemical structure particular dna deoxyribonucleic acid molecules

gene encode information necessary synthesizing aminoacid
sequence protein turn play large role determining
final phenotype physical appearance organismdiploid organism dominant allele one chromosome maskexpression recessive gene
phrase code often used mean gene containsinstruction build particular protein gene
code protein one gene one protein concept known
simplistic example single gene may produce multiple
product depending transcription regulated gene code
nucleotide sequence mrna trna rrna requiredprotein synthesis

genetics determines much appearance organisms
including human possibly act environmental differences
random factor also play part monozygotic identical twinclone resulting early splitting embryodna different personality fingerprints
geneticallyidentical plant grown colder climate incorporate
shorter lesssaturated fatty acid avoid stiffness
