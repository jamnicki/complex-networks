internal membrane

eukaryotic cell include variety membranebound structures
collectively referred endomembrane system simple
compartment called vesicle vacuole form buddingmembrane many cell ingest food materialprocess endocytosis outer membrane invaginatespinch form vesicle probablemembranebound organelle ultimately derived vesicles

nucleus surrounded double membrane commonly referrednuclear envelope pore allow material movevarious tube sheetlike extension nuclear membrane form
called endoplasmic reticulum involvedprotein transport maturation includes rough erribosome attached protein synthesize enterinterior space lumen subsequently generally enter vesicles
bud smooth eukaryoteproteincarrying vesicle released modified stacks
flattened vesicle called golgi body dictyosomes

vesicle may specialized various purpose instance
lysosome contain enzyme break content food
vacuole peroxisomes used break peroxidetoxic otherwise many protozoa contractile vacuole collect
expel excess water extrusomes expel material useddeflect predator capture prey multicellular organism hormones
often produced vesicle higher plant cells

mitochondrion plastids

mitochondrion organelle found nearly eukaryotesurrounded double membrane inner foldedinvagination called cristae aerobic respiration take place
contain dna formed fissionmitochondrion generally held developedendosymbiotic prokaryote probably proteobacteria protozoa
lack mitochondrion found contain mitochondrionderived
organelle hydrogenosomes mitosomes

cyanobacteria usually take form chloroplast like
cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll produce energyphotosynthesis others involved storing food although plastids

endosymbiotic origin also proposed nucleussee eukaryotic flagellum supposeddeveloped spirochaete generally acceptedlack cytological evidence difficulty reconcilingcellular reproduction

cytoskeletal structures

many eukaryote long slender motile cytoplasmic projections
called flagellum composed mainly tubulin shorter
cilium variously involved movement feedingsensation entirely distinct prokaryotic flagellumsupported bundle microtubule arising basal body
also called kinetosome centriole characteristically arrangednine doublet surrounding two singlet flagellum also may hairs
mastigonemes scale connecting membrane internal rods
interior continuous cell cytoplasm

centriole often present even cell groupflagellum generally occur group one two called
kinetids give rise various microtubular root formprimary component cytoskeletal structure often
assembled course several cell division one flagellum
retained parent derived centriole may
also associated formation spindle nuclear
division

protist various microtubulesupported organelles
include radiolaria heliozoa produce axopodia used
flotation capture prey haptophytespeculiar flagellumlike organelle called haptonema

reproduction

nuclear division often coordinated cell divisiongenerally take place mitosis process allows daughter
nucleus receive one copy chromosome eukaryotes
also process sexual reproduction typically involvingalternation haploid generation one copychromosome present diploid generation two present
occurring nuclear fusion syngamy meiosisconsiderable variation pattern however

eukaryote smaller surface volume area ratioprokaryote thus lower metabolic rate longer generation
time multicellular organism cell specializedmetabolism enlarged surface area intestinal vili
