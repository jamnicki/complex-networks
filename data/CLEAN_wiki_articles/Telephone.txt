introduction

elementary telephone system consists three elements
subscriber system must contain equipment
necessary convert sound electrical signal backallows subscriber answer initiate call
system must contain central switching facilityinterconnects subscribers
finally system requires wiring mean connectsubscriber central switching facility

three principal way subscriber may connectedtelephone network
historically still commonly dedicated physical wire
connection run overhead underground cables
radio cordless cellular satellite radiotelephone
voice internet protocol voip telephone use
