route consistency

since unsuccessful attempt applying briefly popular
schematic theory diagrammatic map linebyline colour codingexclusive use number letter service line descriptions
mta moved steadily toward traditional approachgeographically correct map use traditional linecommunity name map public signage

concurrently refining use number letter
system try achieve consistency across system one major push
ha attempt many service possible servestation route terminal time major exception
service early morning hour approximately
midnight toamto end mta took advantageunavoidable service change forced partial manhattan bridge
closure reroute service bridge track reopenedparticularly brooklyn branch line services
switched becoming bmt brighton line express
service becoming bmt west end line express enabled
full time service operate continuously route
