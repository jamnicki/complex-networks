electromagnets

electromagnet simplest form wire coiled
one loop coil known solenoid electric
current flow along coil magnetic field generated aroundcoil orientation field determined via right
hand rule strength field influenced several factors
number loop determines surface area interactionamount current determines amount activity material
core determines electrical resistance loop wire
