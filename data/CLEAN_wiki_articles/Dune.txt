dune types

subaqueous dunes

subaqueousunderwater dune form bed sand gravelaction water flow ubiquitous natural channelriver estuary also form engineered canalpipeline dune move downstream upstream slope erodedsediment deposited downstream lee slope

dune often form continuous train dune showing
remarkable similarity wavelength height

dune bed channel significantly increase flow resistance
presence growth playing major part river flooding

lithified dunes

ecological succession coastal dunes

dune form plant succession occurs condition embryo
dune harsh salt spray sea carried strong winds
dune well drained often dry rotting seaweed broughtstorm wave add nutrient allow pioneer specie colonizedune pioneer specie marram grass sea wort grasssea grass plant well adapted harsh
condition foredune typically deep root reach
water table root nodule produce nitrogen compoundprotected stoma reducing transpiration also deep root bindsand together dune grows fore dune sandblown grass grass add nitrogen soil meaning
le hardy plant colonize dune typicallyheather gorse adapted low soil water

desertification

one biggest problem posed sand dune encroachment
human habitat sand dune move different meanhelped along wind one way dune movesaltation sand particle skip along ground like rock
thrown across pond might skip across water surfaceskipping particle land may knock particle cause
skip well slightly stronger wind particle collide
midair causing sheet flow major dust storm dune may move
ten meter sheet flow like snow sand
avalanche falling steep slope dune face away
wind also moving dune forward
