method

roman believed inherited art road construction
etruscan doubt art grew went along also
incorporated good idea cultures

architect looked site proposed roaddetermined roughly agrimensores went work
surveying road bed used two main device rod one
called groma helped obtain right angle gromatici
roman equivalent rod men placed rod put line called
rigor posse anything like transitarchitect tried achieve straightness looking along rodcommanding gromatici move required using gromae
laid grid plan road

libratores began work using plough legionaryspade excavated road bed bed rock leastfirmest ground could find excavation called fossa
ditch depth varied according terrain

road constructed filling ditch method varied
according geographic locality material available terrainplan ideal architect aimed alwaysroadbed layered

fossa dumped large amount rubble gravel stone
whatever fill available sometimes layer sand putcould found came within foot surfacewa covered gravel tamped process called pavirepavimentare flat surface pavimentum could used
road additional layer could constructed statumenfoundation flat stone set cement might support additional
layers

final step utilized concrete roman exclusively
rediscovered seem mixed mortar stonefossa first severalinch layer coarse concrete rudusseveralinch layer fine concrete nucleus went ontopavement statumen onto nucleus went coursepolygonal square paving stone see picture
