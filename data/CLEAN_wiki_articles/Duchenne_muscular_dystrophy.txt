duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd also known muscular dystrophy 
duchenne type inherited disorder characterized rapidly
progressive muscle weakness start leg pelvislater affect whole body duchenne muscular dystrophy dmdcommon form muscular dystrophy usually affect males
rare case also affect female xlinked
recessive inherited disease milder form disease knownbeckers muscular dystrophy bmd becker muscular dystrophysymptom similar duchenne onset latercourse milder

dmd named french neurologist guillaume benjamin amand
duchennewho first described diseasedue mutation dystrophin gene encodes cell
membrane protein myocytes muscle cell one third caseknown caused development spontaneous mutation gene
remainder inherited boy dmd develop weak muscles
muscle fiber present birth destroyed
symptom result death ageand respiratory failure usually
result life expectancy ofyears astudy found early
detection disease doe improve lifeexpectancycommon cause death respiratory failure

pathomechanism

duchenne muscular dystrophy caused mutation dystrophin
gene whose protein product responsible linking actin
filament muscle fibre extracellular matrixprotein complex containing many subunit result sarcolemma
damaged shearing force muscle fibre undergo necrosis
ultimately replaced adipose connective tissue

symptoms

main symptom duchenne muscular dystrophy rapidly progressive
muscle weakness associated muscle wasting proximal
muscle first affected especially pelvis calf muscles
muscle weakness also occurs arm neck areaseverely early lower half body symptoms
usually appear ageand may appear early infancyphysical symptomawkward gait
rapidly progressive
frequent falls
difficulty motor skill running hopping jumping
progressive difficulty walking
ability walk usually lost age 
fatigue
mild mental retardation approxof duchennes patients
skeletal deformity including scoliosis cases
muscle deformities
pseudohypertrophy tongue calf muscle enlarged muscle
tissue eventually replaced fat connective tissue
muscle contracture heel leg rendering unusable
muscle fiber shorten fibrosis occurs connective
tissue

sign tests

muscle wasting begin leg pelvis progressmuscle shoulder neck followed loss arm musclerespiratory muscle calf muscle enlargement pseudohypertrophyquite obvious cardiomyopathy may occur developmentcongestive heart failure arrhythmia irregular heartbeat rare
positive gowers sign reflects severe impairment
lower extremity muscle child help getupper extremity first rising stand armknee walking hand leg stand upright
ability walk usually lost age 
creatine kinase cpkmm level bloodstream extremely
high
electromyography emg show weakness causeddestruction muscle tissue rather damage nerves
genetic testing
muscle biopsyimmunohistochemistry immunoblottinggenetic testblood test confirms diagnosis

prognosis

duchenne muscular dystrophy eventually affect voluntary muscles
heart breathing muscle survival rare beyond early
death typically occurs respiratory failure suffocationheart disorders

physiotherapy
