biographical sketch

galileo born pisa tuscany region italy february
son vincenzo galilei galileo first child
seven people believe six authority say watalented children

galileo tutored young age later attendeduniversity pisa forced halt studyfinancial reason however offered position facultytaught mathematics soon moved universitypadua served faculty teaching geometry mechanicastronomy untilduring period concentrated science
made many significant discoveries

although devout roman catholic galileo fathered three
child wedlock marina gamba two daughters
virginia livia one son vincenzioillegitimate birth girl sent convent san matteo
arcetri early age remained restlife virginia took name maria celeste upon entering convent
wa galileo eldest child beloved inheritedfather sharp mind died apriland currently buried

scientific methods

pantheon scientific revolution galileo galilei takehigh position pioneering use quantitative experiments
result analyzed mathematically traditionmethod european thought time great experimentalistimmediately preceded galileo william gilbert usequantitative approach however galileo father vincenzo galileilutenist music theorist performed experimentdiscovered may oldest known nonlinear relation physics
tension pitch stretched stringobservation pythagorean tradition music wellknowninstrument maker wholenumber mathematical relationship define
harmonious pleasing scale thus limited form mathematicslong made way physical science point musicyoung galileo position see father observations
generalize relationship still galileo would find
credit first plainly state law naturemathematical said idea language godmathematics sharp break earlier traditionscience point following aristotle logicmathematics seen basic intellectual tool science

galileo also contributed rejection blind allegianceauthority like church thinker aristotlematter science separation science philosophyreligion primary justification descriptionfather science

th century authority particular distinguished
french historian science alexandre koyr challenged validitygalileo experiment experiment reported two new sciencedetermine law acceleration falling body instance
required accurate measurement time appeared impossible
technology according koyr lawarrived deductively experiment merely illustrative
thought experiments

later research however validated experiment experiments
falling body actually rolling ball replicated usingmethod described galileo settleand precisionresult consistent galileo report later researchgalileo unpublished working paper early asclearly
showed validity experiment even indicatedparticular result led timesquared law drake 

even attempted measure speed lightingenious way
climbed hill told someone else climb another
hill lantern shutters
opened shutter lantern counted seelong took person openusing mathematics tried work fast lighttravelling

tried repeat experiment hill apartstill got time lapse wa measuringreaction time person

galileo showed remarkably modern appreciation proper

galileo also first report lunar mountain crater whose
existence deduced pattern light shadowmoon surface even estimated mountain heightobservation led conclusion moon rough

galileo observed milky way previously believed nebulousfound multitude star packed denselyappeared cloud earth also located many stardistant visible naked eye

galileo observed planet neptune inbut realizewa planet took particular notice appearsnotebook one many unremarkable dim stars

galileo kepler theory tides

galileo never accepted kepler elliptical orbit planets
despite kepler tremendous amount data collected tycho brahe
considering circle perfect shape copernican theory
used epicycle account variation added great deal
complexity kepler model
galileo attributed tide momentum opposed kepler theories
used moon cause neither great scientists
however workable physical theory tide waitwork newton galileo stated dialogue earth

however galileo may first realize see technology

early galileo assistant tried measure speed
light stood different hilltop holding shuttered

saw flash would open shutter distance lemile galileo could detect delay roundtrip time greaterassistant yard apart could
reach conclusion whether light propagated instantaneouslyrecognized distance hilltop perhaps small
