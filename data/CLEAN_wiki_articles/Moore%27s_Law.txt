law often met obstacle appeared
insurmountable soon surmounting sense moore
say see law beautiful realised
moore law violation murphy law everything get betterbetter

considerations

aspect computing technology develop capacity speed
according moore law random access memory ram speed hard
drive seek time improve best percentage point year
since capacity ram hard drive increasing much faster
access speed intelligent use capacity becomes
important make sense many case trade
space time precomputing index storingway facilitate rapid access cost using diskmemory space space getting cheaper relative time

another sometimes misunderstood point exponentially improved
hardware doe necessarily imply exponentially improved softwarego productivity software developer assuredlyincrease exponentially improvement hardwaremeasure increased slowly fitfully decades
software tends get larger complicated timewirths law even state software get slower faster hardware
get faster

moreover popular misconception clock speedprocessor determines speed also known megahertz mythactually also depends number instruction per tickexecuted well complexity instruction see mips
risc cisc clock speed used comparison
two identical circuit course factor must taken
consideration bus size speed peripherals
therefore popular evaluation computer speed inherently
biased without understanding underlying technologyespecially true pentium era popular manufacturers
played public perception speed focusing advertisingclock rate new products

also important note transistor density multicore cpus
doe necessarily reflect similar increase practical computing
power due unparallelized nature applications
