many year actual location battle unknown
competing theory focused first two town alaisefranchecomt alisesaintereine ctedor emperor napoleon

existence roman camp area dedicated statuevercingetorix recently discovered ruins

uncertainty nevertheless persisted question raised
validity alisesaintereines claim exampletopography areait allegedly saiddoes fit caesars
description site also small accommodate even revised
estimate ofmen gallic infantry along cavalry
additional personnel

another theory support location battlechauxdescrotenay gate jura mountain preliminary
research chauxdecrotenay unveiled complete system roman

however archaeological research needed definitively
