historical discovery methods

asteroid discovery method drastically improved past two
centuries

last year century baron franz xaver von zach
organized group ofastronomers search sky missing

naming asteroids

overview naming conventions

newly discovered asteroid given provisional designation
consisting year discovery alphanumeric codeorbit confirmed given number
later may also given name egeros formal naming
convention parenthesis around number egerosdropping parenthesis quite common informally commondrop number altogether drop first mentionname repeated running text

asteroid given number name keepprovisional designation egda modern discovery
technique discovering vast number new asteroidincreasingly left unnamed first asteroid left unnamed
wa long timeva nowsyrinx november
distinction held byfv rare
occasion asteroid provisional designation may become usedname still unnamedqb gave namegroup asteroid became known cubewanos

numbering asteroids

asteroid awarded official number orbitconfirmed increasing rapidity asteroid discovery
asteroid currently awarded sixfigure number switch

numbered asteroid jump fromtothis change caused small
yklike crisis various automated data service since five
digit allowed data format asteroid numberservice widened asteroid number fieldproblem addressed caseleftmost digit tenthousands place use alphabet digit

special naming rules

asteroid naming always freeforall typeasteroid rule developed source nameinstance centaur asteroid orbiting saturn neptunenamed mythological centaur trojan herotrojan war transneptunian object underworld spirits

asteroid symbols

first asteroid discovered assigned symbol like ones
traditionally used designate earth moon sun planets
symbol quickly became ungainly hard draw recogniseend ofthere wereknown asteroid except onesymbol first four main variant shown
cere old planetary symbol cere variant symbol ceres
sickle variant symbol cere sickle variant symbolceres
pallas old symbol pallas variant symbol pallas
juno old symbol juno symbol juno
vesta old symbol vesta old planetary symbol vesta modern
astrological symbol vesta

johann franz encke made major change berliner astronomisches
