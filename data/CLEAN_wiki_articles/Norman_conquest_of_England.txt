significance

change took place norman conquestsignificant english european development

one obvious change introduction latinbased
anglonorman language language ruling class england
displacing germanicbased anglosaxon language anglonorman
retained status prestige language nearlyyearssignificant influence modern englishfirst several major influx latin romance languagepredominant spoken tongue england began lose much germanic
norse vocabulary although retained germanic sentence structure
many cases

another direct consequence invasion near total lossanglosaxon aristocracy anglosaxon control churchengland william subdued rebel confiscated land gave
norman supporter time domesday booktwo english landowner note survived displacementchurch see bishopric held native englishmannormans

medieval european conquest disastrous consequences
defeated ruling class williams prestige among followers
gained tremendous boost able award vast tractland little cost award also basisconsolidating control gift land titlenewly created lord would build castle subdue natives
thus conquest selfperpetuating

governmental systems

even norman arrived anglosaxons onesophisticated governmental system western europe england
divided administrative unit called shire roughly
uniform size shape run official known shire
reeve orsheriff shire tended somewhat autonomouslacked coordinated control anglosaxons made heavy use written
documentation unusual king western europe time
made efficient governance word mouth

anglosaxons also established permanent physical locationgovernment medieval government always move holding
court wherever weather food matter bestmoment practice limited potential size sophisticationgovernment body whatever could packed horse cart
including treasury library anglosaxons establishedpermanent treasury winchester permanent government
bureaucracy document archive begun grow

sophisticated medieval form government handednorman grew even stronger norman centralised autonomous
shire system domesday book exemplifies practical codification
enabled norman assimilation conquered territorycentral control census first kingdomwide census taken
europe since time roman enabled efficient
taxation norman new realm

system accounting grew sophistication government accounting
office called exchequer established henry 
onward located westminster
