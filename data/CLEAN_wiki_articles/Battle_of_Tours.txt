strategic analysis

abdalramn good general done two thingfailed gibbon make point movecharles martel surprised tour martelmarched mountain avoiding road surprise muslim
invader thus wily martel selected time placewould collide
abdalramn either assumed frank would comeaid aquitanian rival care thus failed
