kuomintang service underlined opinion communiststated

impressive personal quality communist leaders
seeming sincerity coherence logical natureprogram lead least toward general acceptancefirst explanationthat communist base policy toward
kuomingtang real desire democracy chinaorderly economic growth stage private
enterprise eventual socialism without need violent social
upheaval revolution

year dixie mission colonel barrett reflected upon
