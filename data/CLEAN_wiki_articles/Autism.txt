history

word autism first used english language swiss

introduced label early infantile autism suggestedterm autism describe fact child seemed lack
interest people kanners first paper subjectpublished defunct journal called nervous child almost
every characteristic originally described still regardedtypical autistic spectrum disorders

however child matures receives educationtraininggradually learn control behavior copedifficult change ways

sensory system

clinician making proper assessment autism would looksymptom much like found sensory integration dysfunction
child exhibit problem coping normal sensory input
indicator autism include oversensitivity underreactivitytouch movement sight sound physical clumsinesscarelessness poor body awareness tendency easily distracted

people autism strong tonal sense often understand
least spoken language whilst others understand language

issue autistic child relatively good language skills
speak like little adult rather communicating current
age level one thing lead problems

since nonautistic people often unfamiliar autistic body

difficulty may contribute autistic people becoming socially

repetitive behaviors

although people autism usually appear physically normalgood muscle control unusual repetitive motion knownselfstimulation orstimming may set apart behaviors
might extreme highly apparent subtle childolder individual spend lot time repeatedly flapping armwiggling toe others suddenly freeze position children
might spend hour lining car train certain
way using type pretend play expectednonautistic child someone accidentally move one toys
child may tremendously upset autistic child often needdemand absolute consistency environment slight changeroutinein mealtime dressing taking bath going school
certain time routecan extremely disturbingautistics sometimes persistent intense preoccupationexample child might obsessed learning computers
tv program movie schedule lighthouse often show great
interest different language number symbol science topics
repetitive behavior also extend spoken word well
perseveration single word phrase even specific numbertime also become part child daily routine
