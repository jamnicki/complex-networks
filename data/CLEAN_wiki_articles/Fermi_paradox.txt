resolving paradox empirically

one obvious way resolve fermi paradox would find

radio emission nontechnological civilizationunlikely detectable earth near future though
microbial life may deduced solar system

viewpoint conjecture type evidence likely found often

might avoid expected activity perform activity totally
novel humans
