general principles

natural selection act phenotype phenotype overall

genetical theory natural selection

natural selection simple concept fitness
difference phenotype play crucial role

however interplay actual selection mechanismunderlying genetics explanatory power natural selection
come
directionality selection

component trait heritable selection alterfrequency different allele variant gene involved
selection divided three class basiseffect allele frequencies

positive directional selection occurs certain allele hagreater fitness others resulting increase frequencyallele fixed entire population expressfitter phenotype

far common purifying stabilizing selection lowerfrequency allele deleterious effect phenotype
lower fitness eliminatedpopulation purifying selection result functional genetic features
eg proteincoding sequence regulatory sequence conserved
time selective pressure deleterious variants

finally number form balancing selection existresult fixation maintain allele intermediate frequencies
population occur diploid specie two pairchromosome individual combination two different
allele single position chomosomeheterozygotehigher fitness individual two allele 
homozygote called heterozygote advantage overdominance
maintenance allelic variation also occur disruptivediversifying selection favor genotype departaverage either direction opposite overdominance

selection genetic variation

portion genetic variation functionally neutral ieproduce phenotypic effect significant difference fitness
previously thought encompass genetic variation
noncoding dna recent study shown large partsequence highly conserved strong purifying
selection vary much individual individual
indicating mutation region deleterious
consequence genetic variation doe result differencefitness selection cannot directly affect frequencyvariation result genetic variation sitehigher site selection doe result

genetic linkage

genetic linkage occurs two allele close proximityformation gamete recombinationgenetic material result reshuffling allele howeverchance reshuffle occurs two allele dependsdistance allele closer allelele likely reshuffle occur
consequently selection target one allele automatically
result selection allele wellmechanism selection strong influence patternvariation genome

mutationselection balance

natural selection result reduction genetic variationelimination maladapted individualmutation cause maladaptation time new
mutation occur resulting mutationselection balance exact
outcome two process depends rate new
mutation occurs strength natural selection
consequently change mutation rate selection pressure
result different mutationselection balance

selective sweep

selective sweep occur allele becomes commonpopulation result positive selection prevalence one
allele increase linked allele nearby chromosomealso become common whether neutral even slightly
deleterious called genetic hitchhiking strong selective
sweep result region genome positively selected
haplotype allele neighbour essentially ones
exist population

whether selective sweep occurred investigatedmeasuring linkage disequilibrium whether given haplotypeoverrepresented population normally genetic recombination
result reshuffling different allele within haplotype
none haplotype dominate population however
selective sweep selection specific allele also
result selection neighbouring allele therefore presencestrong linkage disequilibrium might indicate harecent selective sweep used identify sites
recently selection

background selection

background selection opposite selective sweepspecific site experience strong persistent purifying selection
perhaps result mutationselection balance linked variation
tend weeded along background selection
however act result new mutation occur randomlyhaplotype therefore produce linkage disequilibrium though
reduces amount variation region

evolution mean natural selection

speciation

speciation requires selective mating result reduced gene
flow selective mating result example changephysical environment physical isolation extrinsic barrier
sexual selection resulting assortative mating time
subgroup might diverge radically become different species
