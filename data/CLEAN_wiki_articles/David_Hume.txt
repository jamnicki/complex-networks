problem causation

one event continually follows another people think
connection two event make second event follow
first post hoc ergo propter hocafter therefore
hume challenged belief first booktreatise human nature later enquiry concerning human
understanding noted although perceive one event
following perceive necessary connection
two according skeptical epistemologytrust knowledge acquire perception hume
asserted idea causation consists littleexpectation certain event result eventprecede notion cause effectcertain object always conjoind sic togetherpast instance found inseparable cannot
penetrate reason conjunction observe thing
always find constant conjunction objects
acquire union imagination humewe cannot
actually say one event caused another know sureone event correlated another hume coined term
constant conjunction see one event always
cause another really seeing one eventalways constantly conjoined consequencereason believe one causedcontinue constantly conjoined future popkinstroll
reason believe cause effectcause effect actual way nature believepsychological habit human nature popkinstroll

lean conception robs causation force later
humeans like bertrand russell dismissed notion causation
altogether something akin superstition defies common
sense hence problem causationwhat justifies beliefcausal connection kind connection knowledgeproblem accepted solution hume heldanimal instinctive belief causation baseddevelopment habit nervous system belief cannot
eliminate cannot prove true argument
deductive inductive case regard belief
reality external world

problem induction

enquiry concerning human understanding ehu 
hume articulated view human reasoningtwo kind relation idea matter fact former
involves abstract concept like mathematics deductive certitude
presides latter involves empirical experiencethought inductive since according hume know nothing
nature prior experience even rational manexperience could inferred fluidity transparency
water would suffocate light warmthfire would consume ehuthus say
think predict nature must come prior experiencelay foundation necessity induction

inductive inference say past act reliable guidefuture example past sun risen eastset west inductive inference suggestsprobably rise east set west futurejustify inference known principle induction
hume suggested two possible justification rejectedfirst justification state matter logical
necessity future must resemble past hume pointed
conceive chaotic erratic world future
ha nothing pastor tamely worldlike right present point thing change
completely nothing make principle induction logically
necessary
second justification modestly appeal past
success inductionit worked often pastprobably continue work often futurehume note justification circular reasoningattempting justify induction merely reiterating bringing
u back started

noted century theoretician philosopher bertrand russell
attempted reinstate induction rational procedure restore
credibility scientific method however could sayinduction independent logical principle incapableinferred either experience logical principlewithout principle science impossible

despite hume criticism induction held superiordeduction realm empirical thought stateoperation mind infer like effect like causes
vice versa essential subsistence human
creature probable could trustedfallacious deduction reason slow operations
appears degree first year infancybest every age period human life extremely liableerror mistake ehu 

bundle theory self

hume pointed tend think personfive year ago though weve changed many respectperson appears present present might start thinking
feature changed without changing underlying
self hume however denies distinctionvarious feature person mysterious self supposedly
bear feature start introspecting never
intimately conscious anything particular perception manbundle collection different perception succeed one another
inconceivable rapidity perpetual flux movement

plain course thinking constant
revolution idea imagination run easily one idearesembles quality alonefancy sufficient bond association likewise evidentsens changing object necessitated changeregularly take lie contiguousimagination must long custom acquire method thinking
run along part space time conceiving objects

note particular hume view perceptionbelong anything rather hume compare soul commonwealth
retains identity virtue enduring core
substance composed many different related yet
constantly changing element question personal identitybecomes matter characterizing loose cohesion one personal
experience note appendix treatise hume said
mysteriously dissatisfied account self yet
never returned issue

practical reason instrumentalism nihilism

u find behavior reasonable others eating
aluminum foil example seems something unreasonablehume denied reason important role motivatingdiscouraging behavior reason sort calculator
concept experience ultimately matter hume saidfeel behaviour work associateddoctrine instrumentalism state action reasonable
serf agent goal desire whateverreason enter picture lackey informing agent
useful fact concerning action serve goaldesire never deigning tell agent goal desires
want eat aluminium foil reason tell
find stuff nothing unreasonableeating even wanting unless course one hastronger desire health appearance sensibility today
however many commentator argue hume actually went stepnihilism said nothing unreasonable deliberately
frustrating goal desire want eat aluminum foil
let wire mouth shut behaviour would surely highly
irregular granting reason role would contrary
reason important make judgment domain

sentiment based ethical theory

hume first discus ethic treatise human nature later

argument founding morality reason often includedstable moral antirealist argument humeaninspired
philosopher john mackie suggests exist moral factworld recognizable reason intrinsically motivatingwould queer fact still considerable debate
among scholar hume status realist versus antirealist

free versus determinism

everyone noticed apparent conflict freedeterminismif action determined happen billionyear ago hume noted another
conflict one turned problem free fullfledged
dilemma free incompatible indeterminism imagineaction determined event cameaction seems completely random moreoverimportantly hume determined characteryour
desire preference value etc hold someone
responsible action result characterhold someone responsible action randomly occurred
free seems require determinism otherwise agent
action wouldnt connected way required freely
chosen action nearly everyone belief free free
seems inconsistent determinism free seemsrequire determinism hume view human behaviour like
everything else caused therefore holding people responsible
action focus rewarding punishingway try morally desirabletry avoid morally reprehensible see also

without going human nature without paying

utilitarianism

wa probably hume along fellow member scottish
enlightenment first advanced idea explanation moral
principle sought utility tend promote humes
role overstated course countryman francis
hutcheson coined utilitarian slogan greatest happinessgreatest number reading hume treatise jeremy
bentham first felt force utilitarian system feltscale fallen eye nevertheless humes

problem miracles

hume way support theistic religion beyond strict
fideism appeal miracle saying miracle may
conclude christian religion first attendedmiracle even day cannot believed reasonable
person without one mere reason insufficient convince uveracity whoever moved faith assent conscious
continued miracle person subvertsprinciple understanding give determinationbelieve contrary custom experience

hume argued minimum miracle could never give religion much
support several argument suggested hume essayturn conception miracle namely violationlaw nature definition miracle enquiry
concerning human understanding state miracle violationlaw nature consequently low probabilityoccurring slogan extraordinary claim require extraordinary
evidence far hume observes gazing populace
receive greedily without examination whatever soothes superstition

critic argued hume position assumes charactermiracle natural law prior specific examination miracle
claim thus amount subtle form begging question
also noted requires appeal inductive inference

miracle claim yet future observer humes
