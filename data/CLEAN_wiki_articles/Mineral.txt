mineral definition classification

classified true mineral substance must solidcrystal structure must also inorganic
naturallyoccurring homogeneous substance defined chemical
composition chemical composition may vary end membermineral system example plagioclase feldspar comprisecontinuous series sodiumrich albite naalsiocalciumrich anorthite caalsio four recognized
intermediate composition minerallike substance dont
strictly meet definition sometimes classified mineraloids
naturaloccurring substance nonminerals industrial minerals
market term refers commercially valuable mined materials
see also mineral rock section
crystal structure orderly geometric spatial arrangementatom internal structure mineral arebasic
crystal lattice arrangement atom three dimensionreferred thebravais lattice lattices
classified one six crystal system crystal
structure currently recognized fit one bravais lattice one
crystal system crystal structure based regular internal
atomic ionic arrangement often expressed geometric
form crystal take even mineral grain small
see irregularly shaped underlying crystal structurealways periodic determined xray diffraction

chemistry crystal structure together define mineral fact two
mineral may chemical composition differcrystal structure known polymorph example pyrite
marcasite iron sulfide arrangement atoms
differs similarly mineral different chemical compositions
crystal structure example halite made sodium
chlorine galena made lead sulfur periclase made
magnesium oxygen share cubic crystal structure

crystal structure greatly influence mineral physical properties
example though diamond graphite composition
pure carbon graphite soft diamondhardest known mineral happens carbon atomgraphite arranged sheet slide easily pastcarbon atom diamond form strong interlocking

luster indicates way mineral surface interacts light
range dull glassy vitreous
metallic high reflectivity like metal galena
submetallic slightly metallic reflectivity magnetite
vitreous lustre broken glass quartz

like naked eye
streak refers colour powder mineral leafrubbing unglazed porcelain streak plate
cleavage describes way mineral may split apart along various
plane thin section cleavage visible thin parallel lines

classification system

silicate class

largest group mineral far silicate rocksilicate composed largely silicon oxygenaddition ion aluminium magnesium iron calcium
important rockforming silicate include feldspar quartz
olivine pyroxene amphibole garnet micas

carbonate class

carbonate mineral consist mineral containing anion
co include calcite aragonite calcium carbonate
dolomite magnesiumcalcium carbonate siderite iron carbonate
carbonate commonly deposited marine setting shelldead planktonic life settle accumulate sea floor carbonates
also found evaporitic setting great salt lake utah
also karst region dissolution reprecipitationcarbonate lead formation cave stalactitestalagmite carbonate class also includes nitrate borate
minerals

sulfate class

sulfate contain sulfate anion sulfate commonly
form evaporitic setting highly saline water slowly
evaporate allowing formation sulfate halidewatersediment interface sulfate also occur hydrothermal vein
system gangue mineral along sulfide ore mineral another
occurrence secondary oxidation product original sulfide
mineral common sulfate include anhydrite calcium sulfate
celestite strontium sulfate barite barium sulfate gypsum
hydrated calcium sulfate sulfate class also includeschromate molybdate selenate sulfite tellurate tungstate
minerals

halide class

halide group mineral forming natural saltinclude fluorite calcium fluoride halite sodium chloride sylvite
potassium chloride sal ammoniac ammonium chloride halides
like sulfate commonly found evaporitic setting playa
lake landlocked sea dead sea great salt lakehalide class includes fluoride chloride iodide minerals

oxide class

oxide extremely important mining form many ores
valuable metal extracted also carry best
record change earth magnetic field commonly occurprecipitate close earth surface oxidation productmineral near surface weathering zone accessory minerals
igneous rock crust mantle common oxide include
hematite iron oxide magnetite iron oxide chromite iron chromium
oxide spinel magnesium aluminium oxidea common componentmantle ilmenite iron titanium oxide rutile titanium dioxideice hydrogen oxide oxide class includes oxidehydroxide minerals

sulfide class

many sulfide mineral economically important metal ore common
sulfide include pyrite iron sulfidecommonly known fool gold
chalcopyrite copper iron sulfide pentlandite nickel iron sulfide
galena lead sulfide sulfide class also includesselenides telluride arsenide antimonidesbismuthinides sulfosalts sulfur second anionarsenic
