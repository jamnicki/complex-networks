develops seed ovary wall pericarp may become fleshyberry drupe form hard outer covering nutcase sepal petal andor stamen style flower
fall fruit development continues seed matured
multiseeded fruit extent flesh developsproportional number fertilized ovules

wall fruit developed ovary wall flowercalled pericarp pericarp often differentiated twothree distinct layer called exocarp outer layeralso called
epicarp mesocarp middle layer endocarp inner layerfruit especially simple fruit derived inferior ovarypart flower floral tube including petals
sepal stamen fuse ovary ripen plant
hormone ethylene cause ripening floral partsignificant part fruit called accessory fruit since

seedless fruits

seedlessness important feature fruit commerce
commercial cultivar banana pineapple example seedless
fruit cultivar citrus fruit especially navel orangemandarin orange table grape grapefruit watermelon valued
seedlessness specie seedlessness resultparthenocarpy fruit set without fertilization parthenocarpic
fruit set may may require pollination seedless citrus
fruit require pollination stimulus banana pineappleseedlessness table grape result abortion embryonic
plant produced fertilization phenomenon knownstenospermocarpy requires normal pollination fertilization

seed dissemination

variation fruit structure largely depend mode dispersal
seed contain dispersal achieved animals
wind water explosive dehiscence

fruit coat covered spike hooked burr eitherprevent eaten animal stickhair feather leg animal using dispersal agents
example include cocklebur unicorn plant

sweet flesh many fruit deliberately appealing animals
seed held within eaten unwittingly carried away
deposited distance parent likewise nutritious
oily kernel nut appealing rodent squirrelhoard soil order avoid starving winter
thus giving seed remain uneaten chance germinategrow new plant away parent

fruit elongated flattened naturally become
thin like wing helicopter blade maple tuliptree elm
evolutionary mechanism increase dispersal distance away
parent via wind winddispersed fruit tiny
parachute dandelion salsify

coconut fruit float thousand mile ocean spread
