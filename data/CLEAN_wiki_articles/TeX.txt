history

first volume knuths art computer programmingpublished init typeset using monotype technologyth century produced good classic style appreciatedknuth second edition second volume publishedwhole book typeset monotype
technology largely replaced photographic techniqueoriginal font available anymore however knuth
received galley proof new book onmarchhe found
awful around time knuth saw first time output
highquality digital typesetting system became interesteddigital typography disappointing galley proof gave final
motivation solve problem hand designing
typesetting system onmayhe wrote memodescribing basic feature tex

planned finish sabbatical inbut happened
language frozen inmore ten year later guy
steele happened stanford summer ofwhen knuth
wa developing first version tex steele returned mit
fall rewrote texs run operating system
first version tex written sail programming language
run pdp stanford wait operating system later
version tex knuth invented concept literate programmingway producing compilable source code high quality crosslinked
documentation typeset tex course original file
language used called web produce program pascal

new version tex rewritten scratch called texpublished inamong change original hyphenation
algorithm replaced new algorithm written frank liang tex
also fixedpoint arithmetic instead floatingpoint ensure
reproducibility result across different computer hardwareincludes real turingcomplete programming language following
intense lobbying guy steele

indonald knuth released new version tex metafont
despite desire keep program stable knuth realised 
different character text input enough accommodate
foreign language main change versionof tex thusability work bit input allowingdifferent characters
text input

since versiontex used idiosyncratic version numbering
system update indicated adding extra digitend decimal version number asymptotically
approachesthis reflection fact texstable minor update anticipated current versiontex isit last updated decemberthe designfrozen versionand new feature fundamental change
added newer version shall containbug fix even though donald knuth suggested areas
tex could improved indicated firmly
belief unchanged system produceoutput future important introducing new
feature reason stated absolutely final
change made death change version
number toat point remaining bug become features
likewise version metafont afterasymptotically approach esimilar change applied knuths death

however since source code tex essentially public
domain see programmer allowed explicitly
encouraged improve system required use another name
distribute modified tex meaning source code still
evolve example omega project developed 
primarily enhance texs multilingual typesetting ability donald
knuth created unofficial modified version texxet
allows user mix text written lefttorightrighttoleft writing system document

typesetting system

tex command commonly start backslash grouped curly
brace however almost texs syntactic propertychanged fly make tex input hard parse anythingtex tex macro tokenbased language many commands
including userdefined one expanded flyunexpandable token remain get executed expansionpractically sideeffect free tail recursion macro take memory
ifthenelse construct available make texturingcomplete language even expansion level

system divided four level first characters
read input file assigned category code sometimes
called catcode short combination backslash reallycharacter category zero followed letter character category
single character replaced control sequence
token sense stage like lexical analysis althoughdoe form number digit next stage expandable
control sequence conditionals defined macro replaced
replacement text input third stagestream character including one special meaningunexpandable control sequence typically assignment visual
command character get assembled paragraph texs

arrangement letter per line line per page producedvi file device independent containing final locationcharacter dvi file printed directly given appropriate
printer driver converted format nowadays
pdftex often used bypass dvi generation altogether

base tex system understands aboutcommands called primitives
however lowlevel command rarely used directly users
functionality provided format file predumped memory
image tex large macro collection loaded knuths
original default format add aboutcommands plain tex 
available ctan widely used format latex originally
developed leslie lamport incorporates document stylebook letter slide etc add support referencingautomatic numbering section equation another widely used

used latex using package referred
amslatex format include context used primarilydesktop publishing written mostly han hagen pragma

novel aspect tex
