understand fundamental life processes

plant convenient organism fundamental life processes
like cell division protein synthesis example studied
without ethical dilemma studying animal human genetic
law inheritance discovered way gregor mendelwa studying way pea shape inherited mendel learntstudying plant far reaching benefit outside botany

biological processes

utilise medicine materials

many medicinal recreational drug like cannabis caffeine
nicotine come directly plant kingdom aspirinoriginally came bark willow tree one example
may many novel cure disease provided plant waiting
discovered popular stimulant like coffee chocolate tobacco
tea also come plant alcoholic beverage comefermenting plant barley malt grapes

plant also provide many natural material cotton
wood paper linen vegetable oil type rope rubberproduction silk would possible without cultivationmulberry plant sugarcane plant recently putuse source biofuels important alternative fossil

understand environmental changes

plant also help understand change environmentmany ways
understanding habitat destruction specie extinctiondependent accurate complete catalogue plant
systematics taxonomy
plant response ultraviolet radiation help monitor
problem like ozone depletion
analysing pollen deposited plant thousand million years
ago help scientist reconstruct past climate predict
future one essential part climate change research
recording analysing timing plant life cycleimportant part phenology used climatechange research
lichen sensitive atmospheric conditionextensively used pollution indicators

many different way plant act bit like theminers canary
early warning system alerting important changeenvironment addition practical scientific reasons
plant extremely valuable recreation million peopleenjoy gardening horticultural culinary plant every day
