retina contains two form photosensitive cell importantvisionrods cone though structurally metabolically similar

saccades

saccade quick simultaneous movement eyedirection controlled frontal lobe brain

microsaccades

even looking intently single spot eye drift around
ensures individual photosensitive cell continually
stimulated different degree without changing input cells
would otherwise stop generating output microsaccades move eyetotal ofin adult humans

vestibuloocular reflex

smooth pursuit movement

eye also follow moving object around accurate
vestibuloocular reflex requires brain process
incoming visual information supply feedback following object
moving constant speed relatively easy though eye often
