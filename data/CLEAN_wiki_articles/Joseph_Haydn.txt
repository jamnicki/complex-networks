structure character music

central characteristic haydn music development larger
structure short simple musical motif usually devised
standard accompanying figure music often quite formally
concentrated important musical event movement unfold
rather quickly haydn musical practice formed basis muchwa follow development tonality musical form took

haydn work became central later described sonata form
work central taking binary schematiccalled melodie form divided section joinedimportant moment harmony signalled change onehaydn important innovation adopted mozart beethoven wamake moment transition focus tremendous creativity
instead using stock device make transition haydn would
often find inventive way make move two expected keys

later musical theorist would codify formal organizationfollowing way
introduction present extended form slower sectiontonic often material directly related main
theme would rapidly transitionexposition presentation thematic material includingprogression tonality away home key unlike mozartbeethoven haydn often wrote exposition musicestablishes new key similar identical opening

slow movement surprise symphony nohaydns many
musical joke include false ending quartet 
noand opnoand remarkable rhythmic illusion placedtrio section third movement opno 

haydn compositional practice influenced mozart beethoven
beethoven began career writing rather discursive loosely organized
sonata exposition onset middle periodrevived intensified haydn practice joining musical structure
tight small motif often gradually reshaping workmotif worked effectively together

emotional content haydn music cannot accurately summarised
word one may attempt approximate description muchmusic written please delight prince emotional
tone correspondingly upbeat tone also reflects perhaps
haydn fundamentally healthy wellbalanced personality occasional
minorkey work often deadly serious character form striking
exception general rule haydn fast movement tendrhythmically propulsive often impart great sense energy

minuet tend strong downbeat clearly popular character
early ophaydn turned minuetscherzo much faster one beat bar later
composer notably beethoven used scherzo almost exclusivelyhaydn mostly continued write true minuet though far complex
