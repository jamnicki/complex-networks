hypothesis

snowball earth hypothesis argues documented locationglacial till dropped glacier suggest earth mustcompletely frozen mechanism still
mysterious

one suggestion normally ice spread coveredland thus slowed carbon dioxide absorption increasinggreenhouse effect ice spread would eventually stoptime continent clustered along equator thuscontrol mechanism would work freezing process run
away whole earth iced
frozen condition would tend stabilize frozen earthhigh albedo reflecting sun radiation frozen
earth reduced evaporation dry atmosphere water vapor
one greenhouse gas snowball earth wouldbright clear blue sky reflective surface

mechanism earth would thaw frozen period
would leave distinctive trace subject ongoing

glaciation seems originally considereddegenerate case time james gleick wrote history chaos
