smooth although sometimes covered spine thorns
cauliflory development flower hence fruit directly

rainforest layers

rainforest divided four different partdifferent plant animal adapted life particular area

emergent layer

layer contains emergents small number large trees
grow general canopy reaching height ofm
although occasion specie grow tom orm tallneed able withstand hot temperature dry winds
eagle butterfly bat certain monkey inhabit layer

canopy layer

canopy layer contains majority largest tree typically
tall densest area biodiversity found forest
canopy continuous cover foliage formed adjacent
treetops

canopy estimate home toof plant species

forest floor

bank swamp clearing dense undergrowth foundforest floor relatively clear vegetation little sunlight
penetrates ground level also contains decaying plant animal
matter disappears quickly due warm humid conditions
promoting rapid decay
