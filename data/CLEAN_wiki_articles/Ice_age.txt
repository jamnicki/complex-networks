geological evidence ice age come various form including rock

deposition till tillites glacial erratics successive
glaciation tend distort erase geological evidence making
difficult interpret took time current theoryworked
chemical evidence mainly consists variation ratioisotope sedimentary rock ocean sediment corerecent glacial period ice core evidence also difficultinterpret since factor change isotope ratio examplemajor mass extinction increase proportion lighter isotopesediment ice biological process preferentially use
