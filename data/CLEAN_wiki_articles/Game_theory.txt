simultaneous sequential

simultaneous game game player move simultaneouslymove simultaneously later player unawareearlier player action making effectively simultaneous
sequential game dynamic game game later playerknowledge earlier action need perfect
knowledge every action earlier player mightlittle information instance player may know earlier
player perform one particular action doe know
available action first player actually
performed

important subset sequential game consists game perfect
information game one perfect information player know
move previously made player thus sequential
game game perfect information since simultaneous games
every player know action others game studiedgame theory imperfect information game althoughinteresting example perfect information game includingultimatum game centipede game perfect information game include
also chess mancala arimaa

perfect information often confused complete informationsimilar concept complete information requires every player
know strategy payoff playernecessarily actions

infinitely long games

obvious reason game studied economist realworld game
player generally finished finite number move pure
mathematician constrained set theorist particular
study game last infinitely many move winnerpayoff known move completed

focus attention usually much best way
play game simply whether one playerwinning strategy proven using axiom choicegameseven perfect informationoutcome win losefor neither player winning
strategy existence strategy cleverly designed
