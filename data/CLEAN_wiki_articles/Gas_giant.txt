terminology

term gas giant coined inby science fiction writer
james blish arguably somewhat misnomer since throughout
volume planet distinctionliquid gas since component solid materials
core critical point transition
gas liquid smooth jupiter exceptional case
metallic hydrogen near centre explained much
volume hydrogen helium trace gascritical point observable atmosphere planetle unit optical depth quite thin compared planetary
radius extending perhaps one percent way centre
thus observable portion gaseous contrast marearth gaseous atmosphere crust mayseen

rather misleading term caught planetary scientists
typically use rock gas ice shorthand classelement compound commonly found planetary constituents
irrespective phase appear outer solar system
hydrogen helium gas water methane ammoniaice silicate rock deep planetary interiorconsidered may far say ice astronomers
mean oxygen carbon rock mean silicon gasmean hydrogen helium
