measurement biodiversity

biodiversity broad concept variety objective measures
created order empirically measure biodiversitymeasure biodiversity relates particular use data

practical conservationist measure quantify value
broadly shared among locally affected people otherseconomically defensible definition allow ensuringcontinued possibility adaptation future use people
assuring environmental sustainability

consequence biologist argue measure likelyassociated variety gene since cannot always said
gene likely prove beneficial best choiceconservation assure persistence many gene possible
ecologist latter approach sometimes consideredrestrictive prohibits ecological succession

biodiversity usually plotted taxonomic richness geographic
area reference temporal scale whittaker described
three common metric used measure specieslevel biodiversity
encompassing attention specie richness specie evenness
specie richnessthe primitive index available
simpson index
shannon index

three index used ecologists
alpha diversity refers diversity within particular area
community ecosystem measured counting numbertaxon within ecosystem usually species
beta diversity specie diversity ecosysteminvolves comparing number taxon uniqueecosystems
gamma diversity measure overall diversity different
ecosystem within region

distribution biodiversity

biodiversity distributed evenly earth consistently
richer tropic one approach polar region one find fewer
specie flora fauna vary depending climate altitude soilpresence specie listing distinct ecoregionsyearlarge number earth specie formally
classified rare endangered threatened specie moreoverscientist estimate million specie actually
endangered simply formally recognized

biodiversity hotspot region high level endemic
specie biodiversity hotspot first identified norman myers two article scientific journalenvironmentalistandhotspots unfortunately tend occur
near area dense human habitation leading threat many
endemic specie result pressure rapidly growing
human population human activity many area increasing
dramatically hotspot located tropicforests

example brazil atlantic forest contains roughlyplant
speciesvertebrates million insect halfoccur nowhere else world madagascar dry deciduous forests
lowland rainforest posse high ratio specie endemism
biodiversity arising fact island separatedmainland africamillion year ago

many region high biodiversity well high endemism arisespecialized habitat require unusual adaptation mechanisms
example peat bog northern europe alvar regionstora alvaret oland sweden host large diversity plants

levels

biodiversity underlies many important ecological goodservice provide benefit humans

three main reason commonly cited literaturebenefit biodiversity

ecological role biodiversity

specie provide least one function ecosystemfunction integral part regulating specie balance species
diversity specie health aspect intrinsicecosystem whole survive prosper

ecosystem also provide various infrastructure productionsoil
fertility pollinator plant predator decompositionwaste service purification air water
stabilisation moderation climate decrease flooding
drought environmental disasters

research suggests diverse ecosystem better ablewithstand environmental stress consequently productiveloss specie thus likely decrease ability system

biodiversity management conservation preservation protection

conservation biological diversity become global concern
although everybody agrees extent significance current
extinction consider biodiversity essential basically
two main type conservation option insitu conservationexsitu conservation insitu usually seen ideal conservation
strategy however implementation sometimes unfeasibleexample destruction rare endangered specie habitat sometimes
