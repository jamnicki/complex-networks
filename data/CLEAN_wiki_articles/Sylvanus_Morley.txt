view ancient maya society

morley maintained ancient maya society essentially united
theocracy one almost exclusively devoted astronomical
observation mystically noting even worshipping passagetime idea thompson later work would developfullest extent extensively modified although astronomical
calendric observation clearly important mayapeople seen historical realistic
termsconcerned also dynastic succession political conquestlife achievement actual personages

also believed southern centre copn quirigu
united classical period termed old
empire empire mysteriously collapsed remnant later
migrated northern site chichen itza form new
empire generally accepted time maya
region united single polity rather individual
citystates maintained somewhat independent existence albeit one
fluctuating conquest local subservience dominant
centre support view morley devised tier classification
system relative importance ascribedthenknown main maya site aboutmany site known
classification system seen arbitrary one
contradicted place site textsubstantially read

idea morley put forward include proposal ancient
maya first mesoamerica domesticate maize zea may ssp
