design principle 
inbob scheifler jim gettys set early principlex
add new functionality unless implementor cannot complete
real application withoutimportant decide system decideserve world need rather make system
extensible additional need met upwardly
compatible fashion
thing worse generalizing one examplegeneralizing exampleproblem completely understood probably bestprovide solutiongetpercent desired effect forpercentwork use simpler solution see also worse better
isolate complexity much possible
provide mechanism rather policy particular place user
interface policy client hands

first principle modified design xadd new functionality unless know real applicationrequire
x largely kept principle since reference
implementation developed view extension improvementimplementation whilst remaining almost entirely compatibleoriginalprotocol

user interfaces

x deliberately contains specification application user

implementations

xorg reference implementation serf canonical
implementation due liberal licensing numbervariation free proprietary appeared commercial unix

clientserver separation

x design requires client server operate separatelydevice independence separation client server incur
overhead compared operating system graphicintegrated early version microsoft windowmac advocate recommendedtomb ram reasonable

solution performance issue involve paying attention application
designa common misconception network feature resultexcessive complexity used locally network
capability cause undesirable performance hit modern implementation use local socket shared memory requiringlittle overhead

competitor 
graphic unixlike system use almost universally nevertheless
people attempted writing alternative replacements
x historical alternative include sun news failedmarket nexts display postscript eventually became apples

backwardscompatibility 
competitor attempt avoid overhead working
