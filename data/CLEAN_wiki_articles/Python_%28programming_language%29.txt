history

python conceived late guido van rossum cwinetherlands successor abc programming language capable
exception handling interfacing amoeba operating system
van rossum python principal author continuing central
role deciding direction python acknowledged referring
benevolent dictator life bdfl

invan rossum published code labelled versionto
altsources already present stage development classes
inheritance exception handling function core datatypes
list dict str also initial release module
system borrowed modula van rossum describes module one
python major programming unit python exception model also
resembles modulas addition else clause 
complangpython primary discussion forum python formed
marking milestone growth python userbase

python reached versionin januarya major set features
included release functional programming tool lambda

usage

largest project use python zope application
server mnet distributed file store original bittorrent
client also extensively used google nasa

python successfully embedded number software products
scripting language commonly used animation packages
maya software softimage xsi blender software also
used paint shop pro esri promoting python best choice
writing script arcgis

operating system python standard component gentoo uses
extensively package management system portagestandard tool access emerge

python also integral component popular lamp solution stack
linux apache mysql pythonperl php web development

syntax semantics

python designed highly readable language aim towarduncluttered visual layout english keywords frequentlylanguage use punctuation python requires boilerplatetraditional staticallytyped structured language pascal
ha smaller number syntactic exception special caseeither python indentationwhitespace rather curly
brace keywords delimit statement block increaseindentation come certain statement decrease indentation
signifies end current block python statement include
statement conditionally executes block code
along else elif contraction elseif
statement run block code condition
false
statement iterates iterable capturingelement local variable use attached block
class statement executes block code attaches
local namespace class use object oriented
programming
def statement defines function

statement semantics example def statement
doe execute block immediately unlike statements

cpython doe support continuation according guido van
rossum never however better support coroutinelike
functionality provided inby extending python generators
prior togenerators lazy iteratorsinformation passed
monodirectionally generator pythonitpossible pas information back generator function

python duck typing also known latent typing type constraints
checked compile time rather operation object may
fail signifying given object suitable type
despite enforcing static typing python strongly typed
forbidding operation make little sense example addingnumber string rather silently attempting make sense
python includes number builtin type used varietypurposes
type kind note syntax example
str unicode string immutable wikipedia uwikipedia
list sequence mutable contain mixed typesstring true
tuple sequence immutable contain mixed typesstring true
set set unordered contains duplicate set string true
dict mapping group key value pair keykey false
int integer fixed precision number may transparently expandedlong arbitrary precision 
float number floating point 
complex complex number complex number real number imaginary
unit bool boolean empty list dict set andare also considered
false true false

python also allows programmer define typeform class often used objectoriented styleprogramming new instance class constructed callingclass like fooclass class instances
class type instance allowing metaprogramming
reflection

method object function attached object classsyntax instancemethodargument normal method functions
syntactic sugar classmethodinstance argumentpython method must explicit self parameter access instance
data contrast implicit self objectoriented
programming language example java ruby

implementations

mainstream python implementation also known cpython written
c compliant standard distributed large
standard library written mixture python cpython ships
large number supported platform including microsoft windows

standard library

python large standard library commonly cited one pythons
greatest strength providing tool suited many disparate tasks
come socalled battery included philosophy python
module module standard library augmentedcustom module written either python recently boost library includes library python enable interoperability
c python wide variety tool provided
standard library combined ability use lowerlevel
language c already capable interfacing

standard library particularly well tailored writing
internetfacing application large number standard formats
protocol mime http supported module creating
graphical user interface connecting relational databases
arithmetic arbitrarily precise decimal manipulating regular
expression also included python also includes unit testing
framework creating exhaustive test suites

part standard library covered specificationexample wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pepbutmajority module defined nothing code

programming philosophy

python multiparadigm programming language meanrather forcing programmer adopt particular styleprogramming permit several style object orientationstructured programming fully supported numberlanguage feature support functional programmingaspectoriented programming many paradigm supported using
extension pydbc contract python allow design
contract python dynamic typing reference countingmemory management important feature python dynamic name
resolution bind method variable name program
execution

another target language design ease extensibility
rather everything built language core new
builtin module easily written c python alsoused extension language existing module applications
need programmable interface design small core
language large standard library easilyextensible
interpreter intended van rossum start duefrustration abc espoused opposite mindset

though design python somewhat hostile functional
programming lisp tradition tailcall elimination good
support anonymous closure significant parallels
philosophy python minimalist lispfamily
language scheme

offering choice coding methodology python philosophy
reject exuberant syntax perl favour sparser less
cluttered one perl python developer expressly promoteparticular culture ideology based want language
favoring language form see beautiful explicitsimple alex martelli put python cookbook ed
p describe something clever considered compliment
python culture python philosophy reject perlthereone way approach language design favouradvocating single right approach problem solving

like nearly language community python doeadvocate premature optimisation actively eschews patchnoncritical part cpython would offer marginal increasespeed cost clarity python sometimes

c premature optimisation warned strongly 

neologisms

common neologism python community pythonicwide range meaning related program style say piece
code pythonic say python idiom wellnatural show fluency language likewise sayinterface language feature pythonic saywork well python idiom use mesh well rest
language people also use word pythonesque synonym
pythonic

contrast mark unpythonic code attempt write
c lisp perl code pythonthat provides rough
transcription rather idiomatic translation formanother language concept pythonicity tightly boundpython minimalist philosophy readability unreadable codeincomprehensible idiom unpythonic

user admirer pythonmost especially considered
knowledgeable experiencedare often referred pythonists
pythonistas pythoneers

prefix used show something related python
example use prefix name python applicationlibrary include pygame binding sdl python commonly usedcreate game pyqt pygtk bind gtk respectivelypython pypy python implementation written python prefix
also used outside naming software package major python
conference named pycon

important goal python developer making python fun use
reflected origin name television
series monty python flying circus common practice using
monty python reference example code occasionally playful
approach tutorial reference material examplemetasyntactic variable often used python literature spamegg instead traditional foo bar

influence languages

python design philosophy influenced several programming
languages
boo python heritage explicitit also indentation
similar syntax similar object model boo however uses
static typing closely integrated net framework
ecmascript borrowed iterators generator list comprehensions
python implementation
ruby influenced python specifically matz wishedlanguage closer classical message passing objectoriented
model python
groovy motivated desire bring python design
philosophy java

python development practice also emulatedlanguage system requiring document describing rationale
issue surrounding change language pep also
used tcl directly due python influence
