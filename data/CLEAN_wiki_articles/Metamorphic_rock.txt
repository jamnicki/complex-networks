metamorphic rock result transformation preexisting
rock type protolith process called metamorphism means
change form protolith subjected heat greater 
degree celsius extreme pressure causing profound physical andor
chemical change protolith may sedimentary rock igneous rockanother older metamorphic rock

metamorphic rock make large part earth crustclassified texture chemical mineral assemblage 
metamorphic facies formed deep beneath earth surface
great stress rock high pressure temperatures
also formed intrusion molten rock called magma
solid rock form particularly place contactmagma solid rock temperature high

study metamorphic rock exposed earth surface
following erosion uplift provides valuable
information temperature pressure occur great
depth within earth crust

example metamorphic rock gneiss slate marbleschist

metamorphic minerals

metamorphic mineral form high temperatures
pressure associated process metamorphismmineral known index mineral include sillimanite kyanite
staurolite andalusite garnet

mineral olivine pyroxene amphibole micas
feldspar quartz may found metamorphic rocknecessarily result process metamorphism minerals

crystal migrate thus reorganizing crystal high
pressure cause solution crystal within rock point

foliation

layering within metamorphic rock called foliation derivedlatin word folium meaning leaf occurs strong
compressive force applied one direction recrystallizing
rock cause platy elongated crystal mineralmica chlorite grow long perpendiculardirection force result banded foliated rock
band showing colour mineral formed
texture separated foliated nonfoliated categories
foliated rock product differential stress deforms rock
one plane sometimes creating plane cleavage example
slate foliated metamorphic rock originating shale
nonfoliated rock doe planar pattern stress

rock subjected uniform pressure sidelack mineral distinctive growth habitfoliated slate example finegrained foliated
metamorphic rock phyllite coarse schist coarser gneiss
coarsegrained marble generally foliated allowsuse material sculpture architecture

another important mechanism metamorphism chemical
reaction occur mineral without meltingprocess atom exchanged mineral thus new minerals
formed many complex hightemperature reaction may take placemineral assemblage produced provides cluetemperature pressure time metamorphism

metasomatism drastic change bulk chemical compositionrock often occurs process metamorphism due
introduction chemical surrounding rock water
may transport chemical rapidly great distancerole played water metamorphic rock generally contain many
element absent original rock lackoriginally present still introduction new chemicalnecessary recrystallization occur

type metamorphism

metasomatism change original composition

metamorphic rock textures

five basic metamorphic texture typical rock typeslaty slate phyllite foliation called slaty cleavage
schistose schist foliation called schistocity
gneissose gneiss foliation called gneisocity
granoblastic granulite marble quartzite
hornfelsic hornfels skarn
