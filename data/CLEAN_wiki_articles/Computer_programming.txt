time progressed computer made giant leap areaprocessing power brought newer programing languages
abstracted underlying hardware althoughabstracted language require additional overhead cases
huge increase speed modern computer brought little
performance decrease compared earlier counterpart benefitabstracted language allow easier
learning curve people familiar older lowerlevel
programming language also allow experienced
programmer develop simple application quickly despitebenefit large complicated program programdependent speed still require faster relatively lowerlevel
language today hardware concern raisedoriginal fortran language

throughout second half twentieth century programming waattractive career developed country formprogramming increasingly subject offshore outsourcing
importing software service country usuallylower wage making programming career decision developed countries
complicated increasing economic opportunity less

example computer programming languages

almost evolutionary order

c compiled procedural imperative programming language made
popular basis unix
shell scripting particular using either variant bourne
shell shell popular among unix hacker althoughexact implementation varies among different shell core
principle remain intact providing facility program
flow also seen placing emphasis using external
program although shell feature functions
internally known builtins shell scripting used primarilysystem administration especially task need automated
run specific time backup monitoring file system
maintenance among others also used tool rapid
prototyping exact design program yet clear
enough full implementation often compiled language like
c whilst shell script relatively simple possible
create complex powerful program many implementations
smalltalk inventedwas important fundament object
oriented programming started new programming paradigmsignificantly influenced whole art programming smalltalkpure object oriented language minimalistic syntax
possible nearly everything done inside class
