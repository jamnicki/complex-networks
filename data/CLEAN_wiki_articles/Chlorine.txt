application uses

purification disinfection

chlorine important chemical process water
purification disinfectant bleach ozone also used
killing bacteria preferred many municipal drinking water
system ozone doe form organochlorine compoundremain water treatment

item purify water various forms
used form hypochlorous acid kill bacteriamicrobe drinking water supply swimming pool however
noncommercial swimming pool chlorine used
rather mixture sodium hypochloride mixture sodiumchlorine even small water supply routinely chlorinated
