asimov wrote series science fiction novels
expressly intended youngadult audience originally publisher

television series something like lone ranger radio

casual reader

short storyevidence asimov let recurring character susan calvin expound moral basis behind law calvin pointhuman typically expected refrain harminghuman except time extreme duress like war savegreater number equivalent robot first law likewise
according calvin society expects individual obey instructions
recognized authority doctor teacher forth finally
human typically expected avoid harmingthird law robot plot evidence revolves aroundquestion telling human apart robot specially
constructed appear human calvin reason individual
obeys law may robot simply good man

another character asks calvin robot different
human reply world different robotessentially decent

later essay asimov point analogue lawimplicit design almost tools
tool must safe useknives handle swordhilt grenade hooks
tool must perform function efficiently unless would harm
user
tool must remain intact use unless destructionrequired use safety
