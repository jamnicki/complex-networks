let cannon thunder horrid unison
may sonorous echo resound
cry union liberty

estrofa 
ante patria que inermes tus hijos
bajo yugo cuello dobleguen
tus campias con sangre rieguen
sobre sangre estampe pie
tus templos palacios torres
se derrumben con hrrido estruendo
sus ruinas existan diciendo
de mil hroes patria aqu fue

stanza 
oh country ere child defenseless
bend neck beneath yoke
may field watered blood
may leave footprint blood
may temple palace towers
collapse horrid clamor
ruin continue saying
thousand hero country

patria patria tus hijos juran
exhalar tus ara aliento
si clarn con blico acento
los convoca lidiar con valor
para la guirnaldas oliva
un recuerdo para ellos gloria
un laurel para de victoria
un sepulcro para ellos honour

stanza 
oh country country child swearbreathe last sake
bugle warlike accent
call fight valor
olive wreathes
