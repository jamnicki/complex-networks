beginning

everything started michelsonmorley experiment determine
absolute speed earth theorised luminiferous
aether experiment failure show somethingspeed light independent speed observer means
two person follow light ray different speeds
measure relative speed ray

several article einstein trying explaincould happen important written lorentzpostulated light travel speed etherobject move ether compresseddirection motion time slows stillmind absolute movement thinking moving observer would
measure correct speed light compensation errorreference frame moving along light speed light
relative slower contraction lengthinstrument slowdown time exactly enoughmeasure speed light 
einstein explained effect simpler way usingrelativity principle imagined ray light bouncing two
mirror observer static mirror take given
time observer moving respect take longer
speed light spacecalculated equation transforming time

later using previous equation discovered simultaneitypossible inertial system synchronize several clocks
frame look desynchronized frame different
speed

finally used previous result obtain equationlorentz space contraction

lot people including tried find
inconsistency system lot supposed inconsistencies
paradox proposed took job lookingexplanation one one another scientist named
hermann minkowski showed whole system special
relativity selfconsistent therefore real paradox appear

minkowski space

also modern approach theory depends upon conceptfourdimensional universe first proposed minkowski 
developed result contribution emmy noether
approach concept invariance explore typecoordinate system required provide full physical
description location extent things

modern theory special relativity begin concept 
length everyday experience seems length objects
remains matter rotated moved placeplace think simple length thing isinvariant
however shown illustration actually
suggesting length seems invariant threedimensional
coordinate system

seems provided direction thingtilted arranged represented within coordinate systemcoordinate system fully represent length thing however
clear thing may also changed period timemust think time another dimension move forward
shown following diagram

minkowski realised inthat thing could rearranged time

clock desynchronization

last consequence clock appear phasealong length moving object mean one
observer set line clock synchronisedread time another observer moving along line
high speed see clock reading different timemean observer moving relative see
different event simultaneous effect known relativistic

also made clear length contraction resultapplies rod aligned direction motion right angledirection motion contraction

might also noted special relativity form given

equations

measurement unit simplification lorentz equations

asth distance beam light travels
one second rather estimate speed lightfunction length physical object imprecise
use absolute constant speed lightdefinition second presumably based highly invariant
physical entity define mean meter
