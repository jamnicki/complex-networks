venn diagram showing intersection set violetunion set colored region set xor bcolored region except violet universe represented
rectangular frame

let set
element one member set denoted inifelement set denoted notin 

universe set sometimes denoted bynoteuse word universe mean element considered
necessarily element
empty set null set set element denotedvarnothing sometimes 

unary operator applies single set one unary
operator called logical work taking complement

binary operator applies two set basic binary operators
logical logical perform unionintersection set also derived binary
operator xor exclusive see geometry logic

subset denoted subseteq mean every element set
also set 
proper subset denoted subset mean every element
set also set two set equal

superset denoted supseteq mean every elementset also set
proper superset denoted supset mean every element
set also set two set equal

example

let imagine set contains even number multiple two
universe set contains multiple threeuniverse intersection two set element sets
b would multiple six universe

complement set element set would odd
number universe

chaining operation together

two set joined boolean operation new set
formed operation joined set utilizing
additional boolean operation using previous exampledefine new set set multiple fiveuniverse thus set c would multiple ofin
universe convenient may consider set abintersection set set multiple sixuniverse say set c setmultiple ofin universe could take step
call result set abc

use parentheses

number logical ands number logical maychained together without ambiguity combination andsnots lead ambiguous case case parenthesis mayused clarify order operation always operations
within innermost pair performed first followed next pair
etc operation within parenthesis completed
operation outside parenthesis performed

truth tables

boolean logic using two valuesandthe intersectionunion value may defined using truth table
cap

english language use boolean terms

care taken converting english sentence formal
boolean statement many english sentence imprecise meaning glitter gold could mean nothingglitter gold thing glitter gold

also used interchangeably english certain
cases
always carry umbrella rain snows

always carry umbrella rain snows

sometimes english word opposite meaningboolean logic
give red blue berry usually mean giveberry red blue alternative phrasing standard
written english give berry red wellberry blue

also note word english may correspond either
logical logical xor depending context
start sweat humidity temperature high
logical
want ice cream candy may ice cream candy
logical xor

combination andor sometimes used english specifylogical using word alone might mistaken
meaning logical xor
im chicken andor beef dinner logicalalternative phrasing standard written english imeither chicken beef dinner

use andor virgule generally disfavored formal
written english usage may introduce critical imprecision legal
instrument research finding specification computer
program electronic circuit example statementprogram verify applicant checked male female
box taken xor check added ensure one
one box selected case interpretationenglish may certain author specification may
need consulted determine true intent

applications

digital electronic circuit design

boolean logic also used circuit design electrical
engineering hereandmay represent two different state one
bit digital circuit typically high low voltage circuitdescribed expression containing variable two expressions
equal value variablecorresponding circuit inputoutput behavior
furthermore every possible inputoutput behaviour modeledsuitable boolean expression

basic logic gate gate may used aloneconjunction nand xor gate control digital
electronics circuitry whether gate wired seriesparallel control precedence operations

database applications

relational database use sql databasespecific languageperform query may contain boolean logic application
record table may considered element set
example sql select statement used retrieve data
table database
selectfrom employee lastnamesmith firstnamejohn 

selectfrom employee lastnamesmith orfirstnamejohn 

selectfrom employee lastnamesmith 

parenthesis may used explicitly specify orderboolean operation occur multiple operation present
selectfrom employee lastnamesmith firstnamejo
hn firstnamemary 

multiple set nested parenthesis may also used needed

boolean operation operation combine twotable together referred join relational database
