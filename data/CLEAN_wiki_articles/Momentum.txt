momentum present either gun bulletmoving

conservation momentum collisions

momentum special property closed systemalways conserved even collision kinetic energyhand conserved collision inelastic since
momentum conserved used calculate unknown velocities
following collision

common problem physic requires use factcollision two particle since momentum always conserved sum
momentum collision must equal sum momenta
