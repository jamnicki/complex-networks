many actinrelated molecule create free barbed endpolymerization uncapping severing preexisting filamentusing nucleation core however arp complex stimulates
actin polymerization creating new nucleation core nucleation
core activity arp activated member wiskottaldrich
syndrome family protein wasp nwasp wave protein domain
wasp protein interacts actin monomer region
associate arp complex create nucleation core
however novo nucleation followed polymerizationsufficient form integrated actin network since newly
synthesized polymer would associated preexisting
filament thus arp complex bind preexisting filamentnew filament grow old one form functional
actin cytoskeleton capping protein limit actin polymerizationregion activated arp complex elongated filament ends
recapped prevent depolymerization thus conserve actin
filament

arp complex simultaneously control nucleation actin
polymerization branching filament moreover autocatalysisobserved arpmediated actin polymerization process
newly formed filament activate arp complexes
facilitating formation branched filaments

mechanism actin polymerization arp subject
dispute resent year question complex binds
filament nucleates daughter filament historically
two model proposed describe formation branched
filaments

side branching model

side branching dendritic nucleation model arp
complex bind side preexisting mother filamentpoint different nucleation site arp thus two
actinbinding sitesone bind preexisting actin filament
nucleation branched filament recent
research provides strong support model

barbed end branching model

barbed end branching model arp associate barbed end
growing filament allowing elongation original
filament formation branched filament model mainly
based kinetic analysis rather structural data suggestingbranching induced arp arp incorporated two
different actin filaments

cellular arp

arp complex appears important variety specialized
cell function involve actin cytoskeleton complexfound cellular region characterized dynamic actin filament
activity macropinocytotic cup leading edgelamellipodia motile actin patch yeast mammalsocial amoeba dictyostelium discoideum required phagocytosis
complex also shown involved establishmentcell polarity migration fibroblast monolayerswoundhealing model moreover enteropathogenic organism like listeria
monocytogenes shigella use arp complexactinpolymerization dependent rocketing movement arp complex
also regulates intracellular motility endosomes lysosomes
pinocytic vesicle mitochondrion moreover recent study showarp complex essential proper polar cell expansionplant arp mutation arabidopsis result abnormal filament
organization turn affect expansion trichomes
