harvest

harvest tree deplete nutrient forest poor soilparticularly true whole tree harvest many nutrient held
top branch harvest often doesnt allow different
successional stage forest different stage height agespecie diversity different animal depend harvest

value wildlife forest reducing healthtree overall

six different kind tree harvesting

selective cutting shelterwood cutting seedtree cutting
clearcutting strip cutting

fragmentation

urban sprawl construction fragment forest creates
edge habitat habitat protected tree exposedurban environment area forest spread different
fragment edge areaone lump area narrow lineforest becomes degraded edge little middle edge trees
