spacesuit requirements

several thing needed spacesuit function properlyspace must provide
stable internal pressure earths
atmosphere usually need spacesuit carry
nitrogen lower pressure allows greater mobilityintroduces requirement prebreathing avoid decompression
sickness
breathable oxygen circulation cooled purified oxygencontrolled primary life support system
temperature regulation heat lost space thermal
radiation conduction object physical contactspace suit since heat lost slowly radiation
temperature regulated liquid cooling garment heavy
insulation hand possibly feet
electromagnetic radiation shielding
particle radiation shielding
micrometeoroid protection
mobility
communication system
mean recharge discharge gas liquids
mean maneuver dock release tether space craft

theory spacesuit design

space suit allow user natural unencumbered movement
nearly design try maintain constant volume mattermovement wearer make mechanical work needed
change volume constant pressure system moving armhand cause change volume space suitastronaut extra work every time bend jointha maintain force keep joint bent even forcesmall seriously fatiguing constantly fightsuit also make delicate movement difficult

space suit design try minimize eliminate problemcommon solution form suit multiple layerbladder layer rubbery airtight layer much like balloonrestraint layer outside bladder provides specific shape
suit since bladder layer larger restraint
layer restraint take stress caused pressure
suit since bladder pressure pop
like balloon even punctured restraint layer shapedway bending joint cause pocket fabric called
gore open outside joint makevolume lost inside joint keep suitconstant volume however gore opened wayjoint cannot bent anymore without considerable amount work

three theoretical approaches
hardshell suit usually made metal composite materials
resemble suit armor also designedmaintain constant volume however tend difficultmove rely bearing instead bellow joins
often end odd position must manipulatedregain mobility
mixed suit hardshell part fabric part nasas
extravehicular mobility unit fibreglass hard upper torso
hut fabric limb ilc dover isuit replaces hard upper
torso fabric soft upper torso save weight restricting
use hard component joint bearing helmet waist
seal rear entry hatch
skintight suit mechanical counterpressure suit use heavy
elastic body stocking compress body head encompassed
pressurized helmet rest body pressurized
elastic effect suit eliminatesconstant volume problem reduces possibility space
suit depressurization however suit difficultput face problem providing constant pressure
everywhere proposal use body natural sweat keep
cool see space activity suit information

one inconvenience spacesuit head fixed facing
forward unable turn look sideways astronaut call
effect alligator head
