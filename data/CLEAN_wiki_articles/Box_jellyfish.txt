treatment stings

first aid

swimming beach box jellyfish known presentbottle vinegar extremely useful addition first aid kit
following sting vinegar applied minimum 
second acetic acid found vinegar disables box jellyfishs
nematocysts yet discharged bloodstream though
alleviate pain adherent tentacleremoved removing tentacle without first applying vinegar may
increase discharge nematocysts increasing envenoming vinegar
available however careful removal tentacle handrecommended vinegar helped save dozen life australian
beach although commonly recommended folklore even papers
sting treatment scientific evidence urine
ammonia meat tenderizer sodium bicarbonate boric acid lemon juice
papaya disable stinging indeed substances
may even hasten release venom pressure immobilization bandages
methylated spirit alcohol used jellyfish stings
often severe chironex fleckeri sting cardiac arrest occurs quickly
cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr life saving takes
