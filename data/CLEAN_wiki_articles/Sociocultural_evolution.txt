critique impact modern theories

early century inaugurated period systematic critical
examination rejection sweeping generalisationunilineal theory sociocultural evolution cultural anthropologists
franz boa student like ruth benedict margaret
mead typically regarded leader anthropology rejectionclassical social evolutionism used sophisticated ethnographyrigorous empirical method argue spencer tylor morgans
theory speculative systematically misrepresented
ethnographic data theory regarding stage evolutionespecially criticised illusion additionally rejecteddistinction primitive civilised modern pointing
socalled primitive contemporary society much
history evolved socalled civilised societies
therefore argued attempt use theoryreconstruct history nonliterate leaving historical
document people entirely speculative unscientificobserved postulated progression typically endedstage civilisation identical modern europeethnocentric also pointed theory assumessociety clearly bounded distinct fact cultural
trait form often cross social boundary diffuse among many
different society thus important mechanism change
boa introduced culture history approach concentratedfieldwork among native people identify actual culturalhistorical process rather speculative stage growthculture history approach dominated american anthropologyfirst half century influenced anthropology elsewhere
highlevel generalisation system building became far less
common past

later critic observed assumption firmly bounded societies
wa proposed precisely time european power colonising
nonwestern society thus selfserving many anthropologists
social theorist consider unilineal cultural social
evolution western myth seldom based solid empirical grounds
critical theorist argue notion social evolution simply
justification power elite society finallydevastating world war occurred betweenandcrippled
europe selfconfidence million death genocidedestruction europe industrial infrastructure idea progress
seemed dubious best

thus modern sociocultural evolutionism reject classical social
evolutionism due various theoretical problems
theory deeply ethnocentricit make heavy value judgements
different society western civilisation seenvaluable
assumed culture follow path progressiongoals
equated civilisation material culture technology cities
etc
equated evolution progress fitness based deep
misunderstanding evolutionary theory
