taxonomy

taxonomy naming cerebralis myxozoansgeneral complicated history originally thoughtparasite infected fish brain hence specific epithet cerebralis
however quickly became apparent foundnervous system primarily infects cartilage skeletal tissue
attempt change name myxobolus chondrophagus would
accurately describe organism failed nomenclature

triactinomyxon dubium gyrosalmoclass actinosporeafact triactinomyxon stage cerebralis whose life cycleexpanded include triactinomyxon stage similarlyactinosporeans folded life cycle various
myxosporeans

today myxozoans previously thought multicellular protozoans
