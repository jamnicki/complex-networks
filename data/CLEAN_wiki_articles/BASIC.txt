history

prior mids computer extremely expensive tool used
specialpurpose task simple batch processing arrangement
ran single job time one anotherhowever faster affordable computer became availableextra processing power computer would sometimes sit idle
without job run

programming language batch programming era tendeddesigned like machine ran specific purposes
scientific formula calculation business data processingeventually text editing since even newer expensive
machine still major investment strong tendencyconsider efficiency execution speedimportant feature language general specialized
language difficult use widely disparate syntax

price decreased possibility sharing computer access began
move research lab commercial use newer computer systems
supported timesharing system allows multiple userprocess use cpu memory system operating
system alternate running process giving one running
time cpu switching another machine become
fast enough user could feel machinetheory timesharing reduced cost computing
tremendously single machine could shared amonghundred users

explosive growththe home computer era

notwithstanding language use several minicomputer waintroduction mit altairmicrocomputer inthat

microsoft talking several microcomputer vendor including
ibm licensing basic interpreter computer version

syntax

basic statement terminated line ending unless line
continuation character minimal basic syntax need let
print goto commands

line number distinctive aspect classic home computer
basic due limitation static line numbering basic
interpreter later introduced builtin renumber command allowed
interactive programming modern basic
dialect abandoned line number altogether favour line
label support advanced control structure data declaration
construct available language pascal note also
version basic used line number implementedconstruct well
loops
loops
switch statements
subroutine functions

recent variant visual basic introduced featureeachloop construct looping collectionarray vba visual basicand later even objectoriented
programming inheritance latest version memory management
easier many procedural programming languagecommonly included garbage collector

wealth variant show language user developer
community active basic may seen subculture
dealing computer programming rather fixed setsyntactic rule applies well old computer languages
like cobol fortran although basic movement farlargest may explained large number professionals
learned program basic home computer era
procedure flow control

basic use external library common operation like
language instead interpreter compiler
contains extensive builtin library intrinsic procedure rather
like pascal procedure include toolprogrammer need learn programming write simple applications
including function math string console inputoutput graphics
file manipulation

basic dialect provide builtin structuring facilities
procedure construct programmer must writeprogram using gosub statement hoc argument transmissionemulate structure done expert produces
poorlystructured unmaintainable program commonly referredspaghetti code gosub statement branch simple kind subroutines
without though sometimes parameter local variablemodern version basic microsoft quickbasic added
support full subroutine function basic like fortran
algol pascal make distinction procedure returnvalue called function procedure doe calledsubroutine

function larger sense subroutine returning values
latecomer basic dialect many early system supporteddefinition oneline mathematical function def define
function original dartmouth basic also supported algollike
function subroutine late basic
variant 

data types

basic known good string manipulation function early dialects
already set fundamental function left mid rightstring operation string often used everyday
application considerable convenience advantage many
language time introduction

original dartmouth basic supported numeric string data
type integer type leaving numeric variablefloating point string dynamic could change length
array number string supported well simple
matrix two dimensional arrays

every modern basic dialect least numeric string data
type data type usually distinguished sigil suffixed
character typically string identifier end withwhereas integer
numerics usually end dialect variable mustdeclared using dim statement first usage dialects
require optionally enforce ittypically usingdirective option explicit visual basic default
turned using option explicit many dialect also
support additional type asand bit integerfloatingpoint number polynomial complex listspecialized type designed support particular end user needs
additionally allow userdefined type manner similarpascalrecords structs

basic dialect beyond primitive also support arraynumerics type array must predeclared allocated dim statement used supporttwo higherdimensional array well array nonnumeric
type common advanced basics
dim myintarray integersome version allow dim myintarray

dim mystringarray stringsome version allow dim mystringar
ray

depending dialect basic array based first
element subscriptwhile others based first element
subscriptedso command like firstexample define element array integer elementtoothers may define element array integerelement fromtoor rarely fromtoit may alsopossible set default beginning element number thanor 
additional command option base microsoft basic
example create array element numbered fromto


working string command like second may allocateelement array variablelength string may allocate single
string ofcharacters note also subject basing
difference mentioned
nonstandard intuitive dimensioning
example often confuse novice even advanced programmer
newer dialect offer specific dimensioning dim myintarray 
toas integer would element array elements
numbered fromto 

relational logical operators

equalless equalnotlogical negation
equalgreater equalandlogical conjunction
le thanorlogical disjunction
greater
note lexical distinction assignment
operator equality operator basic single equal signused however method available programmer
visible difference two wanted optional let
keyword allows assignment clearly unambiguously
distinguished use equality operator example let
also note operator actually bitwise
arithmetic operation also used logical operations
basic dialect represent boolean value bytrue
andfalse however resemble bitwise arithmetic
operatorsandrespectively logical operators
andfor example always evaluateargument shortcircuiting operators
