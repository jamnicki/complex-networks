methodology

outset behavioural economics finance theory developed
almost exclusively experimental observation survey responses
though recent time real world data taken prominent
position fmri also used determine area brain
active various step economic decision making
experiment simulating market situation stock market trading
auction seen particularly useful usedisolate effect particular bias upon behavior observed market
behaviour typically explained number way carefully
designed experiment help narrow range plausible
explanation experiment designed incentive compatiblebinding transaction involving real money norm
