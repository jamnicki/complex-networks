applications

elemental bromine used manufacture wide variety bromine
compound used industry agriculture traditionally largest
use bromine production dibromoethane turn
wa used gasoline anti knock agent leaded gasolinelargely phased due environmental considerations

bromine also used manufacture fumigant brominated
flameretardants water purification compound dye medicines
sanitizers inorganic bromide photography etc also usedform intermediate organic synthesis preferrediodine due much lower cost

bromine used make brominated vegetable oil usedemulsifier many citrusflavored soft drinks

aqueous bromine orange used test alkenephenols
added alkene lose colour reacts
forming colorless bromoalkane example reactionethylene produce dibromoethane
added phenol white precipitate tribromophenol
form anilinetribromoaniline precipitate
even water
