half dome granite monolith yosemite national park partsierra nevada batholith

batholith greek bathos depthlithos rock large
emplacement igneous intrusive also called plutonic rock forms
cooled magma deep earth crust batholith almost
always made mostly felsic intermediate rocktypesgranite quartz monzonite diorite see also granite dome

although may appear uniform batholith fact structures
complex history composition composed multiple
mass pluton body igneous rock irregular dimensions
typically least several kilometer distinguishedadjacent igneous rock combination criterion including age
composition texture mappable structure individual plutoncrystallized magma traveled toward surface zonepartial melting near base earth crust

traditionally pluton considered form ascentrelatively buoyant magma large mass called plutonic diapirs
diapir liquefied hot tend rise
surrounding country rock pushing aside partially
melting diapir reach surface form volcanoes
instead slow cool usually solidifytokilometers
underground pluton hence use word pluton reference
roman god underworld pluto also proposed
pluton commonly formed diapiric ascent large magma
diapir rather aggregation smaller volume magmaascended dikes
