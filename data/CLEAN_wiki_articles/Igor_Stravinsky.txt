stravinsky work embraced multiple compositional styles
revolutionized orchestration spanned several genre practically
reinvented ballet form incorporated multiple culture languages
literature consequence influence composerlifetime death remains considerable

compositional innovations

stravinsky began rethinking use motif ostinato early
firebird ballet use element reached full
flowering rite spring

motivic development using distinct musical phrasesubsequently altered developed throughout piece music haroot sonata form mozart age first great innovatormethod beethoven famous fate motif open fifth
symphony reappears throughout work surprising refreshing
permutation classic example however stravinsky use motivic
development unique way permutated motifrite spring introduces additive permutationsubtracting adding note motif without regard changemeter

ballet also notable relentless use ostinatifamous passage noted eighth note ostinatostring accented eight horn occurs section auguryspring dance young girl perhaps first instance
music extended ostinato neither used variationaccompaniment melody various time work
stravinsky also pit several ostinati one another without
regard harmony tempo creating pastiche sort musical
equivalent cubist painting passage notablepastichequality also length stravinsky treats
whole complete musical sections

technique foreshadowed several decade minimalist workcomposer terry riley steve reich

neoclassicism

stravinsky first practitioner neoclassical stylefact german composer richard strauss might firstgreatest example composed mozartian der rosenkavalier 
stravinsky beginning work russian period
others max reger composing manner bach long
stravinsky certainly latter brilliant
neoclassical musician neoclassical style would later adopted
composer diverse darius milhaud aaron copland sergei
prokofiev chided stravinsky neoclassical mannerisms
though sympathetically prokofiev broken similar musical ground
symphony noclassical 

stravinsky announced new style inwith strippeddowndelicately scored octet wind clear harmony looking backclassical music era mozart bach simpler
combination rhythm melody direct responsecomplexity second viennese school stravinsky maypreceded device earlier composer erik satiedoubt copland composing appalachian spring balletwa taking stravinsky model

certainly late neoclassicism accepted
modern genre prevalent throughout art music circle aroundworld ironically stravinsky announced deathneoclassicism least work worldcompletion opera rake progress ina sort final

orchestral innovations

late century early century time ripeorchestral innovation composer anton bruckner gustav
mahler well regarded skill writing medium
turn influenced expansion traditional
classical orchestra richard wagner use large forces
unusual instruments

stravinsky continued romantic trend writing huge orchestral
force especially early ballet startedturn away tendency began innovate introducing
unique combination instrument example lhistoire soldat soldier tale force used clarinet bassoon
cornet trombone violin double bass percussion striking
combination timethis combining distinct timbres
would become almost clich postworld war classical music
stravinsky first composer score two contrabassoonrite spring amongst work vast orchestral pallet

another notable innovation orchestral techniquepartially attributed stravinsky exploitation extreme
range instrument famous passage openingrite spring stravinsky extreme reach bassoon
simulate symbolic awakening spring morning
