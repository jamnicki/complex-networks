history gravitational theory

early prenewtonian history

since time greek philosopher aristotle century
bc many attempt understand explain gravity
aristotle believed effect without causetherefore motion without force hypothesized everything
tried move towards proper place crystalline sphereheaven physical body fell toward centreearth proportion weight another example attempted
explanation indian astronomer brahmagupta 
wrote body fall towards earth natureearth attract body nature waterflow

modern work gravitational theory began work galileo
galilei late century early century famous
experiment dropping ball tower pisa later careful
measurement ball rolling incline galileo showedgravitation accelerates object rate major
departure aristotle belief heavier object accelerated
faster galileo correctly postulated air resistance reasonlighter object appear fall slowly galileo work setstage formulation newton theory gravity

specifics

earth gravity

every planetary body including earth surroundedgravitational field exerts attractive force object
field proportional body mass varies inverselysquare distance body gravitational fieldnumerically equal acceleration object influence
value earth surface denoted approximately
orfts mean ignoring air
resistance object falling freely near earth surface increases
speed byms aroundmph second descent
thus object starting rest attain speed ofms
ft one secondmsfts two
second according newton law earthexperience equal opposite force acting falling
object meaning earth also accelerates towards object
however mass earth huge measurable
acceleration earth force negligible
