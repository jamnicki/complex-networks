meteor shower also known meteor storm celestial event
large number meteor seen within short periodtime meteor small fragment cosmic debris entering
earth atmosphere extremely high speed leaving streak light
quickly disappears small fragment cosmic
debris smaller grain sand almost fragmentburnt never hit earth surface fragment contact
earth surface called meteorites

cause meteor showers
