personality

gauss ardent perfectionist hard worker famous
anecdote gauss interrupted middle problem told
wife dying purported said tellwait moment til wa never prolific writer
refusing publish work consider completecriticism keeping personal motto pauca sed matura
ripe study personal diary revealfact discovered several important mathematical concept yeardecade published contemporary prominent
mathematical historian eric temple bell estimated gauss made
known discovery mathematics would advancedfifty year bell 

another criticism gauss support younger
mathematician followed rarely ever collaboratedmathematician considered aloof austere many
though take student gauss known dislike
teaching said attended single scientific
conference berlin inhowever severalstudent turned influential mathematician amongrichard dedekind bernhard riemann friedrich besseldied sophie germain recommended gauss receive honorary
degree

gauss generally get along male relative father
wanted follow footstep become masonwa supportive gauss schooling mathematics science
gauss primarily supported mother effort likewise
conflict son two migrated united
state want son enter mathematics science
fear sullying family name conflict eugeneparticularly bitter gauss wanted eugene become lawyer eugene
