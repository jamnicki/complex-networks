dna damage

dna damage due environmental factor normal metabolic processes
inside cell occurs rate oftomolecular
lesion per cell per day constitutes onlyofhuman genome approximatelybillion basesbillion base pairs
unrepaired lesion critical gene tumor suppressor genes
impede cell ability carry function appreciably
increase likelihood tumor formation

vast majority dna damage affect primary structuredouble helix base chemically modified
modification turn disrupt molecule regular helical
structure introducing nonnative chemical bond bulky adducts
fit standard double helix unlike protein rna
dna usually lack secondary structure therefore damagedisturbance doe occur level dna however supercoiled
wound around packaging protein called histonesuperstructure vulnerable effect dna damage

type damage

four main type damage dna due endogenous cellular
processes
oxidation base oxodihydroguanine oxoggeneration dna strand interruption reactive oxygen
species
alkylation base usually methylation formationmethylguanine
hydrolysis base deamination depurinationdepyrimidination
mismatch base due dna replication wrong dna
base stitched place newly forming dna strand

damage caused exogenous agent come many form examples
uv light cause crosslinking adjacent cytosine thymine
base creating pyrimidine dimers
ionizing radiation created radioactive decaycosmic ray cause break dna strands
