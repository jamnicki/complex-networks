extraterrestrial hypothesis

another hypothesis proposed inby godfrey louissanthosh kumar two scientist mahatma gandhi universitykottayam kerala collected sample rainwater many
location louis kumar claimed red particle look
like dust instead appeared biological cell chemical
analysis indicate consist organic materialproposed particle may microbe extraterrestrial origin
