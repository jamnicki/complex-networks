notable characteristics

rubidium second electropositive stable alkaline
element liquefies high ambient temperaturefc
like groupelements metal reacts violently watercommon potassium caesium reaction usually vigorous
enough ignite liberated hydrogen rubidium alsoreported ignite spontaneously air also like alkali metals
form amalgam mercury form alloy gold
caesium sodium potassium element give reddish violet
colour flame hence name

uses

potential current rubidium include
working fluid vapor turbines
getter vacuum tubes
photocell component
resonant element atomic clock due hyperfine
structure rubidium energy levels
ingredient special type glass
production superoxide burning oxygen
study potassium ion channel biology

rubidium easily ionized considered use ion
engine space vehicle caesium xenon efficient
purpose

rubidium compound sometimes used firework givepurple colour

rbagi highest room temperature conductivity known
ionic crystal property could useful thin film batteryapplications

rubidium also considered use thermoelectric generator
using magnetohydrodynamic principle rubidium ion formed
heat high temperature passed magnetic fieldconduct electricity act like armature generator thereby
generating electric current

rubidium particularly form vapor onecommonlyused atomic specie employed laser coolingboseeinstein condensation desirable feature application
include ready availability inexpensive diode laser lightrelevant wavelength moderate temperature required obtain
substantial vapor pressures

rubidium used polarizing producing volumes
magnetized gas nuclear spin aligned towardparticular direction space rather randomly rubidium vaporoptically pumped laser polarized polarizeshyperfine interaction spinpolarized cell becoming popular
neutron polarization measurement producing polarized
neutron beam purpose
