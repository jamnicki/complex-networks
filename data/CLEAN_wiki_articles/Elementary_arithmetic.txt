addition













doe mean add two natural number suppose two
bag one bag holding five apple second bag holding three
apple grabbing third empty bag move apple first
second bag third bag third bag hold eight
apple illustrates combination three apple five
apple eight apple generally three plus five eight
three plus five equal eight eight sum threefive number abstract addition group three
thing group five thing yield group eight things
addition regrouping two set object counted
separately put single group counted together count

successor zero one
successor one two
successor two three
successor ten eleven
every natural number successor

predecessor successor number numberexample five successor four therefore fourpredecessor five every natural number except zero hapredecessor

number successor another number first number
said larger number number largeranother number number larger third number
first number also larger third number example
five larger four four larger three therefore five
larger three six larger five therefore sixalso larger three seven larger six therefore seven
also larger three therefore eight larger three
therefore nine larger three etc

two nonzero natural number added together sumlarger either one example three plus five equal eight
therefore eight larger threeand eight largerfivethe symbol larger 

number larger another one smallerfirst one example three smaller eightand fivesmaller eightthe symbol smaller isa number
cannot time larger smaller another number
neither number time larger equalanother number given pair natural number one onefollowing case must true
first number larger second one
first number equal second one
first number smaller second one

counting

count group object mean assign natural numberone object label objectnatural number never assigned object unless predecessor
wa already assigned another object exception zeroassigned object smallest natural number assigned
one largest natural number assigned depends sizegroup called count equal numberobject group

process counting group following
steplet count equal zero count variable
quantity though beginning value zero soonvalue changed several times
stepfind least one object group halabeled natural number object foundlabeled counting finished otherwise choose
one unlabeled objects
stepincrease count one replace valuecount successor
stepassign new value count label unlabeled
object chosen step 
stepgo back step 

counting finished last value countfinal count count equal number object group

often counting object one doe keep track numerical
label corresponds object one keep track subgroup
object already labeled ableidentify unlabeled object necessary stephowever onecounting person one ask person countedkeep track number person self haassigned count finished possible ask group
person file line order increasing numerical
label person would process lining would
something like pair person unsureposition line ask number person
whose number smaller stand left side onelarger number right side person thus pairperson compare number position commuteposition necessary repetition conditional
commutation become ordered
