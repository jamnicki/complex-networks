iceland hotspot hotspot partly responsiblehigh volcanic activity formed island iceland

evidence

iceland one active volcanic region worlderuption occurring average roughly every five year third
basaltic lava erupted recorded history producedicelandic eruption notable eruption included eldgjworld largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed lakiworld second largest several eruption beneath ice
cap generated devastating glacial burst recently

iceland location astride midatlantic ridge eurasian
north american plate moving apart partly responsibleintense volcanic activity additional cause necessaryexplain iceland substantial island rest ridge
mostly consists seamount peak sea levelbelieved mantle plume must lie beneath island enhancingvolcanism already caused plate separation
