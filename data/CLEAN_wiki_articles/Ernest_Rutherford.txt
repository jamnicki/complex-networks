early years

rutherford born spring grove brightwater near nelson
new zealand studied nelson college scholarshipstudy canterbury college university new zealand inafter
gaining bsc two year researchforefront electrical technology rutherford travelled englandpostgraduate study cavendish laboratory university cambridge
wa resident trinity college briefly

alchemist converted nitrogen oxygen workingniels bohr discovered electron moved specific orbits
rutherford theorized existence neutron could
somehow compensate repelling effect positive chargeproton causing attractive nuclear force thus keepingnucleus breaking apart
