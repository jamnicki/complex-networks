overflow dam designed overtopped weir type small
overflow dam used flow measurement

check dam small dam designed reduce flow velocity control

restricts waterway creating faster channel resistsaccumulation sediment

dry dam dam designed control flooding normally hold back
water allows channel flow freely except periods
intense flow would otherwise cause flooding downstream
