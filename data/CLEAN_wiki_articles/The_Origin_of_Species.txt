darwin theory presented

darwin opened argument pointing result domestication
mostly artificial selection though environmental changefood protection predator also factors
comparing domesticated wild variety darwin showednineteenthcentury definition specie chiefly matteropinion since discovery new linking form often degraded
specie varieties

basic theory

darwin theory based five key observation inference drawn
summarized biologist ernst mayr
specie great fertility make offspringgrow adulthood
population remain roughly size modest fluctuations
food resource limited relatively constanttime three observation may inferredenvironment struggle survival among
individuals
sexually reproducing specie generally two individualidentical variation rampant
much variation inheritable

darwin infers world stable populationindividual must struggle survive best
characteristic likely survive desirable
trait passed offspring advantageous
characteristic inherited following generation becoming
dominant among population time natural selection

darwin suggest every variation every character must
selection value however pointedignorance animal physiology relationshipenvironment extremely rash set charactervalueless owner even important noticesuggest every individual favorable variation must
selected selected favored animal betterhigher merely adapted surroundings

darwin infers natural selection carried far enough
make change population eventually leading new specieput forward myriad observation demonstration also
claim fossil record interpreted supportingobservation darwin imagined might possible lifedescended original specie ancient time modern dna
evidence consistent idea

work whole though darwin successful convincing many
scientist especially younger generation evolutionhappened one form another course next two

evolution occurred natural selection though find
wide support actively attacked relatively unpopularrevival creation modern evolutionary synthesistheand similarly darwin notion evolution occurred
gradually also often attacked many evolutionary

darwin theory changed way human saw world

clear human also animal natural world took darker

philosophical implications

according ernst mayr darwin evolutionary thinking restrejection essentialism assumes existence perfect
essential form particular class existent treats
difference individual imperfection deviation away
perfect essential form darwin embraced instead mayr
callspopulation thinking denies existenceessential form hold class conceptualizationnumerous unique individual individual short realobjective sense class abstraction artifactepistemology emphasis importance individual differences

mayr claim essentialism dominated western thinking two
thousand year darwin theory thus represent important
radical break traditional western philosophy rippledarwin thought seen field economicscomplexity theory suggesting darwin influence extends well
