following independent discovery herbig haro metastronomy conference tucson arizona herbig initially paid
little attention object discovered primarily
concerned nearby star hearing haros findingcarried detailed study soviet astronomer viktor
ambartsumian gave object name based occurrence
near young star hundred thousand year old suggestedmight represent early stage formation tauri stars

study showed object highly ionised early theorists
speculated might contain lowluminosity hot star however
absence infrared radiation nebula meant could
star within would emitted abundant infrared
light later study suggested nebula might contain
protostars eventually object came understood material
ejected nearby young star colliding supersonic speedinterstellar medium ism resulting shock waves
generating visible light
