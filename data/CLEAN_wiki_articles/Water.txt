electrical conductivity

common misconception water powerful conductor
electricity risk electrocution explaining popular
belief electrical property observable water ions
mineral salt carbon dioxide dissolved waterselfionize two water molecule become one hydroxide anionone hydronium cation enough carry enough electric current
work harm operation pure water sensitive
equipment detect slight electrical conductivity 
pure water also electrolyzed oxygen hydrogen gases
without dissolved ion slow process thus
little current conducted
