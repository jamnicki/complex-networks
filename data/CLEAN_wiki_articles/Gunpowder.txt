characteristic use

unlike smokeless propellant act like explosive sinceburn rate affected pressure poor explosive
ha slow decomposition rate therefore low
brisance property make poor explosive makeuseful propellantthe lack brisance keep black powder

black powder relatively low energy density compared modern
smokeless powder extremely large quantity soot left
