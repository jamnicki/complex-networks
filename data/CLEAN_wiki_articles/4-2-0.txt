history

firstbuilt experiment later named brother jonathan
mohawk hudson railroad init built west
point foundry based design john jervis little else
reference manufacturer patterned boiler valve gears
locomotive built robert stephenson england

developed thedesign first long boiler
locomotive altered place two pair wheel front
outside cylinder improve stability

design modification thedesign commonamerica theproved rigid railroad day
often derailing tight curve quick elevation changeamerican railroad thejervis designed fourwheel leading
truck locomotive smoke box swiveled independentlymain frame locomotive piston powered single driving
axle rear locomotive behind fireboxdesign resulted much stable locomotive able guide
curve easily 

design proved effective american railroad manyearly rebuilt theexcelled ability
stay track one driving axle locomotives
weight spread small proportion powered wheelmeant total power substantially reduced

one possible solution patented inby charles george seller caused locomotive tip upward ascendinggrade plan placed locomotive weight driving
axle reducing weight leading truck also madeprone derailments

practical solution first put production norris moved
driving axle location frame frontlocomotive firebox cantilevering weight fireboxlocomotive crew behind driving axle placed weightdriving axle without substantially reducing weight leading
