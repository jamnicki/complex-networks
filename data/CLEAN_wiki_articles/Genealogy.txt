type genealogical information

class information genealogist seek include place names
occupation family name first name date genealogist needunderstand item historical context order properly
evaluate genealogical sources

place names

place name ancestor residence locationlife event certainly core element genealogist questoften confusing place name may subject variant spellings
partially literate scribe additionally location maysubstantially similar name example name broctonvillage occurs six time border area english
county shropshire staffordshire shift political borders
must also understood instance county border cthcth
england frequently modified outlying detached areas
reassigned county old record may contain references
middle age village ceased exist due diseasefamine

many source provide location ancestor life event place
residency include vital record civil registration
census tax assessment oral tradition also important
source although must used caution source
information available birth death marriage location
circumstantial evidence may provide probable answer basedplace residence individual individual familytime event

map gazetteer important source understanding places
ancestor born lived married died show relationship area neighboring community may help understand migration patterns

occupations

occupational information may important understand ancestors
life two people name may distinguishedoccupation also person occupation may relatedsocial status political interest migration pattern since
skilled trade often passed father son occupation mayindirect evidence family relationship

important remember occupation sometimes changed may
easily misunderstood workman longer fit primary trade
often take prestigious job later life many unskilled
ancestor variety job depending season local trade
requirement census return may contain embellishment eglabourer mason journeyman master craftsman nameold unfamiliar local occupation may cause confusion poorly
legible example ostler keeper horse hostlerinnkeeper could easily confused one another likewise
description occupation may also problematicperplexing description ironer rabbit burrow may turndescribe ironer profession bristol district named rabbit
burrow several trade regionally preferred term example
shoemaker cordwainer meaning finally many
apparently obscure job part larger trade communitywatchmaking framework knitting gunmaking

occupational data may reported occupational license tax
assessment membership record professional organization trade
directory census return vital record civil registration
occupational dictionary available explain many obscurearchaic trades

family names

family name simultaneously one important piecegenealogical information source significant confusionresearchers

culture name person reference familybelongs called family name surnameoften also called last name speaker english
family name come given name name howevercase culture chinese family name precedegiven name

patronymic name allow identification individual based
father name marga olafsdottir olfa thorsson many
culture used patronymic surname adopted cameuse dutch new york example used patronymic systemname untilwhen advent english rule mandated surname
usage

place name surname personal name data may subjectvariant spelling older record may include greater variationspelling modern record phonetic spelling may link
two variantly spelled name quilter kieltagh
record may also include completely different variant namemort mordecai

transmission name across generation marriagerelationship immigration also cause significant inaccuracygenealogical data instance child may sometimes takegiven stepparent foster parent adoptive parent name womanmany culture routinely used spouse surname woman
remarried may changed name name children
name changed name birthmaiden name mayreflected childrens middle name middle namedropped entirely

official record capture many kind surname changeexample fostering commonlaw marriage love affair changecareer location may result name changereflected official records

difficulty also arise researching family line common
surname smith surname common particular geographic
area many time amateur researcher assume persondirect ancestor based solely givensurnames later find
person related distant relative

surname data may found trade directory census return birth
deathmarriage records

given names

genealogical data regarding given name first name subjectmany problem family name place names

additionally nickname personal name commonbeth
lizzie betty common elizabeth confusedeliza patty used diminutive form martha also amy
used alice nancyann polly used number feminine
name including mary ann elizabeth feminine nameconfusing masculine name also interchange jack john 
jonathan josephjosiah edwardedwin etc

middle name provide additional information middle name mayinherited follow naming custom middle name may sometimestreated part family name instance latin
culture mother family name father family name
used child official record may record full namevariety way first middle last last middle first last first
middle last first
historically naming convention existed place name
given one child sometimes dictated particular formula
important recognize however naming conventionused family always follow formulapattern naming common particular area
particular time

example scotland following convention existed
st sonnamed paternal grandfather
nd sonnamed maternal grandfather
rd sonnamed father
th sonnamed father oldest brother
st daughternamed maternal grandmother
nd daughternamed paternal grandmother
rd daughternamed mother
th daughternamed mother oldest sister

child died generally next child genderborn given name quite often list particular
couple child show one two name repeated sometimesor 
time although confusing also assist researcher
discovering date death previous siblingname

personal name period popularity uncommon
find many similarlynamed people generation even
similarlynamed family william mary children
david mary john

many name may identified strongly particular gender william boy mary girl name may ambiguous
eg lee slightly variant spelling based gender
eg france usually female francis usually male

dates

wise exercise extreme caution skepticism information
date date difficult recall year event
easily mistranscribed type genelogical
data therefore one evaluate whether date recordedtime event later date date birth vital
record civil registration church record baptismgenerally accurate usually recorded near timeevent family bible often reliable source datewritten memory long event inkhandwriting used entry date probably writtentime therefore reliable since earlier
date least probably recorded well eventpublication date bible also provides clue dates
recorded since could recorded earlier
date

people sometimes reduce age marriage perhapsfull age may increase age order marry joinarmed force census return notoriously unreliable ageassuming approximate death date thecensus ukrounded next lower multiple five year also caution
used estimating date husband death basedabsence census woman home husband away
could identified head household assumed widow

baptismal date often used approximate birth date however
family waityears baptising child adult
baptism unknown addition birth marriage dates
may adjusted cover prewedding pregnancycommon first child born within monthmarriage sometimes baptised mother name later adopting
father name parent marriage father nameused even marriage occurred

calendar change must also considered inthe date new
year changed england american colony beforethe
new year started march inthis changedst january part transition gregorian calendar
julian calendar many european country already
made change bythere anday discrepancydate england date european country date
continued recorded usual inuntil septemberthe
following day became septemberdates recordedolder system shown double dating example original

th march 

event occurring beforein country julian calendar
wa still use best use double dating whenever exact
year ascertained transcribing original recordexact year evident expressed double date written
example march 

one also aware place using old julian
calendar numbering month also varied monthyear considered march second april third maythosedays march fell beginning yeargenerally regarded part first month

note foregoing may true british genealogical recorddoe way apply record country notable exception
nordic country especially sweden detailed
mostly accurate record form church record century onwards

software

genealogy software computer software used collect store sort
display genealogical data minimum genealogy software tends
accommodate basic information individual including births
marriage death many program allow additional biographical
information including occupation residence note many genealogy
program also offer easy method keeping track sourcefact

certain program geared toward specific religion include
additional field relevant religion program focuscertain geographical regions

program allow import digital photograph sound
file program focus ability generate kinship charts
family history book publication programflexible others allowing input sex marriages
child born wedlock

move incorporate field input genealogical dna
test result though information added notes
field almost genealogy software

genealogy software allow export data gedcom
format shared people using different genealogy
software certain program allow user restrict information
