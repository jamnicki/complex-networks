rainbow optical meteorological phenomenon causenearly continuous spectrum light appear sky sun
shine onto droplet moisture earth atmosphere takes
form multicoloured arc red outside violetinside double rainbow includes second fainter arccolor opposite order

even though rainbow span continuous spectrum colours
traditionally full sequence colour commonly citedred orange yellow green blue indigo violet commonly
thought indigo included due different religious
connotation number six seven time isaac newtons
work light despite lack scientific significance poor
ability human distinguish colour blue portionvisual spectrum

scientific explanation

rainbow effect observed whenever water dropair sunlight shining behind observer low altitude
angle spectacular rainbow display half skystill dark draining cloud observer spotclear sky overhead rainbow effect also commonly seen near
waterfall fountain rainbow fringe sometimes seenedge backlit cloud vertical band distant rain virga
effect also artificially created dispersing water
droplet air sunny day

rainbow appearance caused dispersion sunlightrefracted approximately spherical raindrop light first

index rain water radius rainbow sea spraysmaller true rainbow visible naked eyemisalignment bow 

since water dispersive amount sunlight bent
depends upon wavelength hence colour lights
constituent part blue light refracted greater angle red
light area back droplet focal
point inside droplet spectrum cross therefore
red light appears higher sky form outer colourrainbow contrary popular belief light backraindrop doe undergo total internal reflection however light
emerges back raindrop doe create rainbow
observer sun spectrum emitted backraindrop maximum intensity visible

remembering sequence colours

traditional way recalling seven colour rainbow
sequence using mnemonic richard york gave battlevain first letter word corresponds first
letter colour mnemonic probably alludes defeatdeath richard duke york battle wakefield battle
richard started although could also refer defeat
richard iii last yorkist king battle bosworth field
york alternative version taught rowntrees york
gave best value referring confectionery rowntrees another
le obvious though common way use meaningless name
roy biv roygbiv method purely phonetic humorous
example also exist including ring granny bootvinegar

mnemonic follow tradition including colour indigo
blue violet newton inserted indigo probablyincrease number colour sevena theologically preferred
number source omit indigo partly due poor abilityhuman distinguish colour blue portion visual
spectrum since rainbow composed nearly continuous spectrum
different people notably across different culture identify
different number colour rainbows
