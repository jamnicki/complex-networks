philosophy language

russell first philosopher suggest languageimportant bearing understand world howeveranyone russell made language specificallyuse language central part philosophy russell
seems unlikely philosopher ludwig wittgenstein
gilbert ryle l austin f strawson among others would
embarked upon course much waamplify respond sometimes critically russell said
using many technique originally developed
russell along moore shared idea clarity expression
virtue notion touchstone philosopher ever
since particularly among deal philosophylanguage

perhaps russell significant contribution philosophylanguage theory description presented seminal
essay denoting first published inin mind philosophical
journal mathematician philosopher frank ramsey
described paradigm philosophy theory normally
illustrated using phrase present king francepresent king france bald object propositiongiven present king france roughlyproblem would arise two king france present
doe king france denote alexius meinongsuggested must posit realm nonexistent entitysuppose referring use expressionwould strange theory say least frege employing
distinction sense reference suggestedsentence although meaningful neither true falseproposition present king france baldpresent king france hair head seemtruthvaluable indeed obviously true

problem general calleddefinite descriptions
normally includes term beginning sometimes
includes name like walter scott point quite contentious
russell sometimes thought latter term shouldnt called
name disguised definite description much
subsequent work treated altogether different thinglogical form definite description freges terms
could paraphrase order show truth whole
depends truth part definite description appearlike name nature denote exactly one thing neither
le say propositionwhole one part apparently isnt functioning correctly

russell solution first analyze term aloneentire proposition contained definite descriptionpresent king france bald suggested rewordedx present king france nothingx present king france bald russell claimed
definite description fact contains claim existence
claim uniqueness give appearancebroken apart treated separately predicationobvious content proposition proposition wholesay three thing object definite description contains
two rest sentence containsobject doe exist unique whole sentence
turn false meaningless

one major complaint russell theory due originallystrawson definite description claim object
exists merely presuppose doe strawson also claimdenoting phrase doe fact denote anything couldsupposed follow role widgys inverted truthvalueexpress opposite meaning intended phraseshown using example present king france bald taken
inverted truthvalue methodology meaning sentence

wittgenstein russell student achieved considerable prominencephilosophy language posthumous publicationphilosophical investigation russell opinion wittgensteins
later work misguided decried influencefollower especially member socalled oxford schoolordinary language philosophy believed promoting kindmysticism russell belief philosophy task limitedexamining ordinary language widely acceptedphilosophy

logical atomism

perhaps russell systematic metaphysical treatmentphilosophical analysis empiricistcentric logicism evident
called logical atomism explicated setlecture philosophy logical atomism gave 
lecture russell set forth concept ideal
isomorphic language one would mirror world wherebyknowledge reduced term atomic propositiontruthfunctional compound logical atomism form radical
empiricism russell believed important requirementideal language every meaningful proposition must
consist term referring directly objectacquainted defined term referringobject acquainted russell excluded certain formal
logical term forth isomorphic
requirement never entirely satisfiedunderstanding term one central theme russells
atomism world consists logically independent factplurality fact knowledge depends datadirect experience later life russell came doubt
aspect logical atomism especially principle isomorphism
though continued believe process philosophy oughtconsist breaking thing simplest component even
though might ever fully arrive ultimate atomic fact

epistemology

russell epistemology went many phase shed
neohegelianism early year russell remained philosophical
realist remainder life believing direct
experience primacy acquisition knowledgeview lost favour influence remains strongdistinction two way familiar objects
knowledge acquaintance andknowledge descriptiontime russell thought could acquaintedsense datamomentary perception colour sound likeand
everything else including physical objectsense data could inferred reasoned toie knowndescriptionand known directly distinction gained much
wider application though russell eventually rejected ideaintermediate sense datum

later philosophy russell subscribed kind neutral
monism maintaining distinction materialmental world final analysis arbitraryreduced neutral propertya view similar one heldamerican philosopherpsychologist william james onefirst formulated baruch spinoza russell greatly admired
instead james pure experience however russell characterisedstuff initial state perception event stancecuriously akin old teacher whitehead process philosophy

philosophy science

russell frequently claimed convinced methodphilosophy method analysis philosophical
conclusion science course one principal componentanalysis along logic mathematics russell wabeliever scientific method knowledge derived empirical
research verified repeated testing believedscience reach tentative answer scientific progresspiecemeal attempt find organic unity largely futile
indeed believed true philosophy another foundermodern philosophy science ernst mach placed reliancemethod per believed method produced

doubtless agree practical matter believedultimate objective science philosophy understand
reality simply make predictions

fact russell made science central part methodphilosophy instrumental making philosophy sciencefullblooded separate branch philosophy areasubsequent philosopher specialised much russell thinkingscience exposed hisbook knowledge external
world field scientific method philosophy among several
school influenced russell logical positivists

worth noting outside strictly philosophical pursuits
russell always fascinated science particularly physiceven authored several popular science book abc atom 
abc relativity 

ethics

russell wrote great deal ethical subject matterbelieve subject belonged philosophy wrote
ethic capacity philosopherearlier year russell greatly influenced moore principia
ethica along moore believed moral factobjective known intuition simple
property object equivalent pleasure goodnatural object often ascribed see naturalistic
fallacy simple undefinable moral property cannotanalyzed using nonmoral property associated
time however came agree philosophical hero david
hume believed ethical term dealt subjective valuecannot verified way matter fact coupled

meaningless nonsensical best little expressions
attitude preference notwithstanding influencerussell construe ethical proposition narrowlypositivist believed ethical considerationmeaningful vital subject matter civil
discourse indeed though russell often characterised patron
saint rationality agreed hume said reason ought
subordinate ethical considerations

religion theology

russell ethical outlook personal courage facing
controversy certainly informed religious upbringing

exodussomething say influenced throughout life
