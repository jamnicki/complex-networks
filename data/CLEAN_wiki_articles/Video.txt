video quality

video quality measured formal metric like psnrsubjective video quality using expert observation

subjective video quality video processing system mayevaluated follows
choose video sequence src use testing
choose setting system evaluate hrc
choose test method present video sequence experts
collect ratings
invite sufficient number expert preferably fewer
carry testing
calculate average mark hrc based experts
ratings

many subjective video quality method described itut

video compression method digital
wide variety method used compress video stream video
data contains spatial temporal redundancy making uncompressed
video stream extremely inefficient broadly speaking spatial
redundancy reduced registering difference partsingle frame task known intraframe compressionclosely related image compression likewise temporal redundancyreduced registering difference frame taskknown interframe compression including motion compensationtechnique common modern standard mpeg useddvd satellite television mpeg used home video
