background

early military influences

rocket interested scientist amateur centurychinese used weapon early century russian
scientist konstantin tsiolkovsky theorizedmultistage liquid fuel rocket might reach spaceestablished basic rocket science rocket equationdetermines flight velocity still used design modern
rocket also wrote first theoretical description manmade
satellite indid american robert goddard designpractical liquid fuel rocket

goddard performed work rocketry obscurity scientific
community public even new york time scoffedtook war catapult rocketry notoriety proved harbingerfuture space race would become inextricably linkedmilitary ambition nation involved despite mostly
scientific character peaceful rhetoric

german contributions

high altitude distance inthe reichswehr predecessorwehrmacht took interest rocketry longrange artillery

second space second everything

american public initially discouraged frightened sputnik
became captivated american project followed
