terminology

central eclipse often used generic term total annularhybrid eclipse however completely correctdefinition central eclipse eclipse central
line umbra touch earth surface possible though
extremely rare part umbra intersects earth thus
creating annular total eclipse central linecalled noncentral total annular eclipse

term solar eclipse technically misnomer phenomenon
moon passing front sun eclipseoccultation properly speaking eclipse occurs one object
pass shadow cast another object examplemoon disappears full moon passing earth shadow event
properly called lunar eclipse therefore proper rarely
used term commonly called solar eclipse eclipseearth
