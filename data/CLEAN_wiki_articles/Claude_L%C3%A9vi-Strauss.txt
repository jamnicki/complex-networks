anthropological theories

lvi strauss theory set forth structural anthropology 
briefly considers culture system symbolic
communication investigated method others used
narrowly discussion novel political speech sports
movies

reasoning make best sense background earlier
generation social theory wrote relationshipdecades

preference functionalist explanation dominated social
science turn centurysay anthropologist sociologist tried state social
act institution existence thing explainedfulfilled function strong alternative kindanalysis historical explanation accounting existencesocial fact saying came
however idea social function developed two different ways
english anthropologist alfred reginald radcliffebrownread admired work french sociologist mile durkheim
argued goal anthropological research findcollective function religious creed set rulemarriage social order whole back approach
wa old idea view civilization developed series
phase primitive modern everywhereactivity given kind society would partakecharacter sort internal logic would cause one level culture
evolve next view society easily thought
organism part functioning together like part body

influential functionalism bronislaw malinowski described
satisfaction individual need person gotparticipating custom

united state shape anthropology setgermaneducated franz boa preference historical accounts
approach obvious problem lvi strauss praise boafacing squarely

historical information seldom available nonliterate cultures
anthropologist fill comparison cultureforced rely theory evidential basis whateverold notion universal stage development claimcultural resemblance based untraced past contactgroup boa came believe overall pattern social
development could proven historyhistories

three broad choice involved divergenceschoolseach decide kind evidence use whetheremphasize particular single culture look patterns
underlying society source underlying
pattern might definition common humanity

social scientist tradition relied crosscultural studies
wa always necessary supplement information societyinformation others idea common human natureimplicit approach

critical distinction remained doe social fact exist
functional social orderfunctional person uniformity across culture occur
organizational need must met everywhereuniform need human personality

lvi strauss choice demand social order
difficulty bringing inconsistency trivialityindividualistic account malinowski said example magic
belief come people need feel sense control
event outcome uncertain trobriand islands
found proof claim rite surrounding abortionweaving skirt tribe magic attachedmaking clay pot even though certain businessweaving explanation consistent furthermoreexplanation tend used hoc superficial wayyoupostulate trait personality need
accepted way discussing organizational function didnt work
either different society might institution similar
many obvious way yet served different function many tribal
culture divide tribe two group elaborate rules
two group interact exactly 
trade intermarryis different different tribe matter
criterion distinguishing groups

say dividingintwo universal needorganization lot tribe thrive without

lvi strauss method linguistics became modelearlier examination society analogy usuallyphonology though also later music mathematics chaos theory
cybernetics
truly scientific analysis must real simplifyingexplanatory say structural anthropology phonemic analysis

generated relatively small number rules

study kinship system first concernedideal explanation allowed comprehensive organization datapartly ordered researcher overall goal wafind family relation differed different south american
culture father might great authority son one
group example relationship rigidly restricted taboos
another group mother brother would kindrelationship son father relationship relaxed
playful

number partial pattern noted relationmother father example sort reciprocityfather sonif mother dominant social statusformal father example father usually close
relation son smaller pattern joined togetherinconsistent ways

one possible way finding master order rateposition kinship system along several dimension example
father older son father produced sonfather sex son matrilineal uncle
wa older sex produce sonexhaustive collection observation might cause overall
pattern emerge

lvi strauss kind work analytical appearance
result chart far harder understandoriginal data based arbitrary abstraction empirically
father older son researcher declares
feature explains relation furthermore doesnt
explain anything explanation offer tautologicalif agecrucial age explains relationship doe offerpossibility inferring origin structure

proper solution puzzle find basic unit kinship
explain variation cluster four
rolesbrother sister father son role mustinvolved society incest taboo requiring manobtain wife man outside hereditary line brother
give away sister example whose son might reciprocatenext generation allowing sister marry exogenously
underlying demand continued circulation woman keep
various clan peacefully related

right wrong solution display quality structural
thinking even though lvi strauss frequently speaks treating
culture product axiom corollary underliephonemic difference constitute concernedobjective data field research note logically
possible different atom kinship structure existsister
sister brother brother wife daughterbutrealworld example relationship derivedgrouping

purpose structuralist explanation organize real datasimplest effective way science say either

lvi strauss later work controversial partimpinge subject matter scholar believedmodern life history founded categorytransformation discovered brazilian back country

displacement kind known recorded history insteadmythic category encompassed changes

argued view human life existing two timelines
simultaneously eventful one history long cycleone set fundamental mythic pattern dominates perhaps
