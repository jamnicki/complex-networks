arithmetic operations

traditional arithmetic operation addition subtraction
multiplication division although advanced operationmanipulation percentage square root exponentiationlogarithmic function also sometimes included subject
arithmetic performed according order operation setobject upon four operation arithmetic performed
except division zero wherein four operation obeyusual law called field

addition 

addition basic operation arithmetic simplest form
addition combine two number addend term single
number sum

adding two number viewed repeated additionprocedure known summation includes way add infinitely
many number infinite series repeated addition number one
basic form counting

addition commutative associative order terms
added doe matter identity element additionadditive identity isthat adding zero number yield
number also inverse element addition additive
inverse opposite number adding oppositenumber number yield additive identity 
example opposite ofisso

subtraction 

subtraction essentially opposite addition subtraction finds
difference two number minuend minus subtrahend
minuend larger subtrahend differencepositive minuend smaller subtrahend difference
negative equal difference zero

subtraction neither commutative associative reasonoften helpful look subtraction addition minuendopposite subtrahend abab written
sum property addition hold
