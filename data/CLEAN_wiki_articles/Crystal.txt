chemistry mineralogy crystal solidconstituent atom molecule ion packed regularly
ordered repeating pattern extending three spatial dimensions

generally crystal form undergo process solidification
ideal condition result may single crystalatom solid fit crystal structure however
generally many crystal form simultaneously solidification
leading polycrystalline solid example metals
encountered everyday life polycrystals crystal often
symmetrically intergrown form crystal twins

cooling process usually result generationcrystalline material certain condition fluid may frozen
noncrystalline state case involves coolingfluid rapidly atom cannot travel lattice sitelose mobility noncrystalline material longrange
order called amorphous vitreous glassy material also
often referred amorphous solid although distinct
difference solid glass notably processforming glass doe release latent heat fusionreason many scientist consider glassy material viscous liquids
rather solid although controversial topic seeentry glass details

crystalline structure occur class materialtype chemical bond almost metal exists polycrystalline
state amorphous singlecrystal metal must produced
synthetically often great difficulty ionically bonded crystals
form upon solidification salt either molten fluidcondenses solution covalently bonded crystal also
common notable example diamond silica graphite
polymer material generally form crystalline regionlength molecule usually prevents complete crystallization
weak van der waals force also play role crystal structure
example type bonding loosely hold togetherhexagonalpatterned sheet graphite
