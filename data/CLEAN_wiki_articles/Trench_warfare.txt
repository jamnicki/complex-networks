background

fortification nearly old warfare howeverrelatively small size army lack rangeweapon traditionally possible defend short
defensive line isolated strongpoint long fortifications
ancient world great wall china hadrians

although art fortification art weaponry advanced
great deal second half second millennium adventlongbow muzzleloading musket even artillerysubstantially change traditional rule fortification required
large body troop defend small number troop simply
could maintain volume fire sufficient repel determined
attack
