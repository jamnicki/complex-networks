sugarcane propagated cutting rather seed although
certain type still produce seed modern method stem cuttingbecome common method reproduction cutting must
contain least one bud cutting usually planted hand
planted stand cane harvested several timeharvest cane sends new stalk called ratoons usually
successive harvest give smaller yield eventuallydeclining yield justify replanting depending agricultural
