nomenclature

naming element precedes atomic theory matter although
time known chemical elementcompound learned existing name gold mercury
iron kept country national difference emerged
name element either convenience linguistic niceties
nationalism example german use wasserstoffhydrogen sauerstoff oxygen englishromance language use sodium natrium potassiumkalium french prefer term azote nitrogenalso used greeks

international trade official name chemical
element ancient recent decided international union
pure applied chemistry decided sortinternational english language organization recently
prescribed aluminium caesium take place spelling aluminium cesium sulfur takeplace british sulphur chemical practicablesold bulk within many country however still national
name use latin alphabet cannot expected
use iupac name according iupac full name element
capitalized even derived proper noun unlesswould capitalized rule instance beginsentence

second half twentieth century physic laboratory became
able produce nucleus chemical element half lifeshort remain appreciable amount also
named iupac generally adopts name chosendiscoverer lead controversial questionresearch group actually discovered element question delayed
naming element atomic number ofand higherconsiderable time see element naming controversy

precursor controversy involved nationalistic namingelement late nineteenth century example lutetiumnamed reference paris france german reluctantrelinquish naming right french often calling cassiopeium
british discoverer niobium originally named columbiumreference new world used extensively american

chemical symbols

specific chemical elements

chemistry became science alchemist designed arcane
symbol metal common compound however used
abbreviation diagram procedure concept one
atom combining form molecule advance atomic
theory matter john dalton devised simpler symbol basedcircle used depict molecules

current system chemical notation invented berzeliustypographical system chemical symbol used mere
abbreviationsthough consists letter latin alphabet 
symbol intended used people languagealphabet first symbol intended fully
universal since latin common language science time
abbreviation based latin name metalsfe comes
ferrum argentum symbol followedperiod full stop abbreviation later chemical elementalso assigned unique chemical symbol based nameelement necessarily english example sodium hachemical symbol latin natrium applies wolfram tungsten hydrargyrum mercury kalium
potassium stibium antimony

chemical symbol understood internationally element names
might need translated sometimes differenceexample german used instead iodinecharacter would confused roman numeral

first letter chemical symbol always capitalizedpreceding example subsequent letter always
lower case small letters

general chemical symbols

also symbol series chemical element comparative
formula one capital letter length letterreserved permitted given namespecific element example used indicate variable
group amongst class compound though usually halogenr used radical meaning compound structurehydrocarbon chain letter reserved heat chemical
reaction also often used general chemical symbol although
also symbol yttrium also frequently usedgeneral variable group used represent general ligandinorganic organometallic chemistry also often used place
general metal

isotope symbols

although officially used nuclear physic three main
isotope element hydrogen often written protiumdeuterium tritium order make easieruse chemical equation replaces need writeamu isotope written like
doheavy water

instead writing like
