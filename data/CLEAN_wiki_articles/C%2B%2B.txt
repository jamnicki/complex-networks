philosophy

design evolution cbjarne stroustrup describes
rule design knowing rule helps
understand way following summaryrule much detail found design evolutionc
c designed statically typed generalpurpose language
efficient portable c designed directly comprehensively support multiple
programming stylesprocedural programming data abstraction
objectoriented programming generic programming
c designed give programmer choice even makes
possible programmer choose incorrectly
c designed compatible possible therefore
providing smooth transition c avoids feature platform specific general
purpose
c doe incur overhead feature used
c designed function without sophisticated programming
environment

standard library

thec standard consists two part core languagec standard library latter includes standard template
library slightly modified version standard library many
c library exist part standard using
external linkage library even written 
c standard library incorporates standard librarysmall modification make work better language
another large part library based standard template
library stl provides useful tool containerexample vector list iterators generalized pointer provide
container arraylike access algorithm perform
operation searching sorting furthermore multimaps 
associative array multisets provided export
compatible interface therefore possible using templatewrite generic algorithm work containersequence defined iterators feature libraryaccessed using include directive include standard header
c provides sixtynine standard header nineteendeprecated

using standard libraryfor example using stdvectorstdstring instead cstyle arraycan help lead saferscalable software

stl originally thirdparty library later sgi
incorporation standard standard doerefer stl merely part standard library
many people still use term distinguish restlibrary inputoutput stream internationalization diagnostics
c library subset etc

c compiler provide implementation standard

custom implementation standard library stlvarious design goals

feature introduced 
compared language introduced extra feature including
declaration statement functionlike cast new delete bool
reference type inline function default argument function
overloading namespaces class including classrelated features
inheritance member function virtual function abstract
class constructor operator overloading template 
operator exception handling runtime type identification

contrary popular belief introduce const keyword
first const formally added shortly adoptedc

c also performs type checking several case see
incompatibility c
comment starting two slasheswere originally part predecessor bcpl reintroduced 
several feature later adopted including declarations
loop cstyle comment using thesymbol inline
though definition inline keyword compatiblec definition however also introduced featureexist variadic macro better handling arrayparameter compiler may implement featureextension others incompatible existing features

common source confusion subtle terminology issue
derivation c term object mean memory
area like class instance meanobject oriented language example c
statement int defines object type int memory
area value variable stored assignment

incompatibility 
c often considered superset strictly
true code easily made compile correctly cdifference cause valid code invalid
c behave differently 
perhaps commonly encountered difference allows
implicit conversion void pointer type cfollowing valid code
int imallocsizeofintimplicit conversion void int


make work c one would need use explicit
cast
int iintmallocsizeofint

another common portability issue defines many new keywords
new class may used identifier variable
name program

incompatibility removed latest c
standard support feature ascomments mixed
declaration code however introduced number new features
conflict variablelength array native
complexnumber type compound literal language maydiverging converging

order intermix c code code called
fromused must put extern code

preprocessor

c principally compiled three phase preprocessing translation
object code linking two last phase generally
thought compilation proper first phase
preprocessing preprocessor directive apply lexical transformationsource code fed next compilation stage

preprocessor directive macros

preprocessing directive work simple substitution tokenized
character sequence tokenized character sequence according
userdefined rule typically perform macro substitution
inclusion file opposition higherorder featureinclusion modulespackagesunitscomponents conditional

templates

template different macro compiletime
language feature used produce conditional compilation
template restricted lexical substitution templateawareness semantics type system companion language

operation including programmatic flow control based evaluationstrictly typechecked parameter macro capable conditional
control compilation based predetermined criterion cannot
instantiate new type recurse perform type evaluation effect

objects

c introduces objectoriented feature offers
class provide four feature commonly present oononoo language abstraction encapsulation inheritancepolymorphism object set class basically likeset attribute already defined created time

encapsulation

c implement encapsulation allowing member classdeclared either public private protected public memberclass accessible function private memberaccessible function member classfunction class explicitly granted access permission class
friend protected member accessible memberclass inherit class addition classfriends

oo principle function accessinternal representation type encapsulated withintype definition support via member function friend
function doe enforce programmer declare parts
representation type public also
allowed make public entity part representation
type support programmingweaker decomposition paradigm like modular programming

generally considered good practice make data privateprotected make public function partminimal interface user class hide implementation
details

inheritance

inheritance base class may declared public protectedprivate access specifier determines whether unrelated derived
class access inherited public protected memberbase class public inheritance corresponds usually
meant inheritance two form much frequently
used access specifier omitted inheritance assumedprivate class base public struct base base class may
declared virtual called virtual inheritance virtual
inheritance ensures one instance base class existsinheritance graph avoiding ambiguity problemmultiple inheritance

multiple inheritance feature sometimes considered
controversial multiple inheritance allows class derivedone base class result complicated graphinheritance relationship example flying cat classinherit cat flying mammal languagec java accomplish something similar although limitedallowing inheritance multiple interface restrictingnumber base class one interface unlike class provideimplementation function members

polymorphism

c support several kind staticcompiletime dynamic 
runtime polymorphism compiletime polymorphism doe allowcertain runtime decision runtime polymorphism typically
incurs performance penalty

static polymorphism

function overloading

function overloading allows program declare multiple functionname function distinguished number andor
type formal parameter thus function namerefer different function depending contextused

operator overloading

similarly operator overloading allows program define certain
operator asorto result function calldepends type operand used
class function templates

template provide sophisticated mechanism writing generic
polymorphic code particular curiously recurring
template pattern possible implement form static
polymorphism closely mimic syntax overriding virtual
method dynamic polymorphism technique described since template typeaware turingcomplete also usedlet compiler resolve recursive conditionals generate
substantial program template metaprogramming

dynamic polymorphism

polymorphism inheritance

variable pointer reference base class type crefer object derived class type additionobject exactly matching variable type allows arraycontainer given type object hold pointer multiple types
object cannot done otherwise assignment
value variable usually occurs runtime necessarily
runtime phenomenon

c also provides dynamiccast operator allows programsafely attempt conversion object objectspecific object type opposed conversion general type
always allowed feature relies runtime type
information rtti object known certain specific typealso cast type staticcast purely compiletime
construct faster doe require rtti

virtual member functions

virtual member function different object share common
base class may support operation different way member
function implemented derived class said overridemember function base class contrast function
overloading parameter given member function always
exactly number type type objectmethod called varies addition standard member functions
operator overload destructors also virtual

virtue inherited object polymorphic maypossible compiler determine type objectcompile time decision therefore put runtimecalled dynamic dispatch way specific implementation
function called according actual runtime typeobject commonly done using virtual function tables
may sometimes bypassed prepending fully qualified class
name function call call virtual functiongeneral always resolved run time

example

include iostream

problem controversies

c subject debate traditionally compilerrange problem standard doe cover implementation
name mangling exception handling implementationspecific
feature making object code produced different compilers
incompatible however rdparty standard particular
machine operating system attempt standardize compilerplatform example abi compiler adopt secondary
standard items

many year different compiler implemented languagedifferent level compliance standardimplementation varied widely area partial template
specialization recent release popular compiler support
almost cstandardone particular pointcontention export keyword intended allow template
definition separated declaration first compiler

provide example code implementing keyword export example
beginning ansi ivor horton compilereference problem keyword export mentionedcompiler gcc support herb sutter secretary
c standard committee recommended export removedfuture version standardbut finally decision made
leave standard 

modern critic language raise several point first since based largely compatible inheritscriticism levelled language taken whole ha large
feature set including plus large set additions
part leading criticism bloated complicated
language especially embedded system due featureexception rtti add code size embedded standard
wa specified deal part received criticismleaving useful part language incur runtime penalty
large featureset quite difficult fully
master leading programmer often bringing unnecessarily advancedcomplicated solution simple problem relatively
difficult write good parser modern algorithm see 
partly grammar lalrtool analyzing performing nontrivial
transformation refactoring existing code

c also sometimes compared unfavorably singleparadigm
objectoriented language java basis allows
programmer mix match objectoriented procedural
programming rather strictly enforcing single paradigmpart wider debate relative merit two programming
styles
