caloris basin also called caloris planitia impact cratermercury diameter one largest impact basinsolar system caloris latin heat basin sonamed
sun almost directly overhead every second time mercury

two kilometer tall

appearance

caloris basin discovered image taken mariner 
probe init situated terminatorthe line dividing
daytime nighttime hemispheresat time probe passed
half crater never imaged

formation

body inner solar system experienced heavy bombardmentlarge rocky body first billion year solar
system impact created caloris basin must occurred
heavy bombardment finished fewer impact
crater seen floor exist comparablysized regions
outside crater similar impact basin moon mare
imbrium mare orientale believed formedtime possibly indicating spike large
impact towards end heavy bombardment phase early
solar system

global effects

giant impact believed formed caloris mayconsequence whole planet exact antipode basin
large area hilly grooved terrain known weird
terrain thought created seismic
wave impact converged opposite side planet 
hypothetical impact also believed triggered volcanic
activity mercury resulting formation smooth plain 

emission gas

mercury tenuous transient atmosphere containing small
amount hydrogen helium captured solar wind wellheavier element sodium potassium thoughtoriginate within planet outgassed beneath crust
caloris basin found significant source sodium
potassium indicating fracture created impact
facilitate release gas within planet weird
terrain also source gas
