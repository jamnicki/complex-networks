financing decision

achieving goal corporate finance requires corporate
investment financed appropriately since hurdle rate
cash flow hence riskiness firm affected
financing mix impact valuation management must therefore
identify optimal mix financingthe capital structureresult maximum value see balance sheet wacc fisher separation

source financing generically comprise combination
debt equity financing project debt resultliability must servicedand hence cash flow
implication regardless project success equity financingle risky sense cash flow commitment resultdilution ownership earnings cost equity also
typically higher cost debt see capm waccequity financing may result increased hurdle rate may
offset reduction cash flow risk

management must also attempt match financing mix asset
financed closely possible term timing cash
flows

one main theory firm make financing decisionpecking order theory suggests firm avoid external
financing internal financing available avoid new
equity financing engage new debt financingreasonably low interest rate another major theory tradeoff
theory firm assumed tradeoff tax benefit debt
bankruptcy cost debt making decision one last

dividend decision

general management must decide whether invest additional
project reinvest existing operation return free cashdividend shareholder dividend calculated mainlybasis company unappropriated profit business prospects
coming year npv positive opportunity return exceed hurdle rate management must return
excess cash investorsthese free cash flow comprise cash
remaining business expense metgeneral case however exception example investorgrowth stock expect company almost definition
retain earnings fund growth internally case even
though opportunity currently npv negative management may
consider investment flexibilitypotential payoff decideretain cash flow see real options

management must also decide form distribution generally
cash dividend via share buyback various
consideration shareholder pay tax dividend company may
elect retain earnings perform stock buyback cases
increasing value share outstanding company pay
dividend stock rather cash see corporate action
