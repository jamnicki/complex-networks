disputed quotation

inan elderly supporter named james rusling recalledmckinley said religious delegation

truth didnt want philippine cameu gift god knowsought counsel sidesdemocrats well republican 
got little help thought first would take manilaluzon island perhaps also walked floorwhite house night night midnight ashamed
tell gentleman went knee prayed
almighty god light guidance one night one
night late came wayi dont know wacamethat could give back spainthat wouldcowardly dishonorablethat could turnfrance germanyour commercial rival orientthat would
bad business discreditablethat could leavethemselvesthey unfit selfgovernmentand would
soon anarchy misrule worse spain wawa nothing left takeeducate filipino uplift civilizechristianize god grace best couldfellow men christ also died went
bed went sleep slept soundly

question whether mckinley said thing italicized
pointespecially regarding christianize nativewhether rusling added mckinley religious person never
said god told anything mckinley never used term
christianize indeed rare inmckinley operatedhighly effective publicity bureau white house gave
hundred interview reporter hundred public speechpromote philippine policy yet authentic speech newspaper
report contains anything like purported word sentiment man
remembered ita civil war veteranhad written book war
wa full exaggeration supposed highly specific quotememory year event unlikely enoughespeciallyquote word like christianize never used mckinley
conclusion historian lewis gould remotely
possible highly unlikely mckinley said last partdiscussion question see gouldpp
