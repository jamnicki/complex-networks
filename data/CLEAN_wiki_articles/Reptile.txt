secondary palate varying degree snake took different approach

excretion

excretion performed mainly two small kidney diapsid uric
acid main nitrogenous waste product turtle like mammals
mainly excrete urea unlike kidney mammal bird reptile
kidney unable produce liquid urine concentratedbody fluid lack specialised structure present
nephron bird mammal called loop henlemany reptile use colon cloaca aidreabsorption water also able take water storedbladder excess salt also excreted nasal lingual
saltglands reptiles

nervous

advanced nervous system compared amphibian twelve pairs
cranial nerves

sexual

reptile reproduce sexually male reptile except turtletortoise twin tube like sexual organ called hemipenes
turtle tortoise single penis testudo lay eggs
none live bearing lizard snake reproductive
activity occurs cloaca single exitentrance base
tail waste reproduction happens

asexual reproduction identified squamates six families
