samuel huntington similarly defines civilization highest

civilization complex systems

another group theorist making use system theory lookcivilization complex system network city emergepreurban culture defined economic political
military diplomatic cultural interaction
example urbanist jane jacob defines city economic
engine work create large network people main process
creates city network say import replacement
import replacement process peripheral city beginreplace good service formerly importedadvanced city successful import replacement creates economic growth
peripheral city allows city export
good developed city hinterland creating
new economic network jacob explores economic development across
wide network instead treating society isolated cultural
