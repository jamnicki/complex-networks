significance

hundred year war time military evolution weapons

partly response demand war partlyadvancement technology partly lesson warfare

drawn feudal obligation professional captain appointedrecruited troop specified theoretically short periodmodern army extent necessitymany baron refused goforeign campaign feudal service supposed protection
realmalso gave england military advantage early
hundred year war heavy cavalry consideredpowerful unit army war end belief shifted
heavy horse increasingly negated use longbowfixed defensive position menatarms tactic helped leadenglish victory crcy agincourt learning scotenglish began using lightly armoured mounted troop would
dismount order fight battle end hundred years
war meant fading expensively outfitted highly trained
heavy cavalry

although tactical advantage nevertheless sizefrance prohibited lengthy let alone permanent occupationmilitary writer general fuller noted covering much larger areaengland containing four time population france proved
difficult english occupy

insoluble problem english commander agesiege warfare territory occupied greaterrequirement garrison lessened striking power english
army time went salisbury army orleans consistedmen insufficient invest city also
numerically inferior french force within without cityfrench needed recover part shattered confidence

furthermore ending burgundian alliance spelt endenglish effort france despite campaign aggressive
john lord talbot force stay inevitable

war also stimulated nationalistic sentiment devastated france

england able raise enough money taxation create
standing army first time since fall western roman

towards centralised nationstates eroded medieval order

first major battle war battle crcy said
age chivalry came end ironicallyrevival chivalry time deemedhighest importance fight die chivalrous way
possible english even apologised fighting nonchivalrously
saying choice since unfairly outnumbered
leaving dirty business welsh nonenglish french
speaker lesson french would take long time learn
great cost also began fight chivalrous ways
notion chivalry strongly influenced romantic epicth century knight literally imagined reenacting
