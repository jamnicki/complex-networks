population overview

estimate many people living america columbus
arrived varied tremendously century scholarly estimates
ranged low ofmillion high ofmillion persons
given fragmentary nature evidence precise precolumbian
population figure impossible obtain estimate often
produced extrapolation comparatively small bit datageographer william denevan used various estimate derive
consensus count aboutmillion people although recent
estimate lower anthropologist population
geneticist agree bulk indigenous american ancestrytraced ice age migration asia bering land bridge
though believe previous seafaring people contributed small
population stocks

historian david henige representing selfdescribed minority
opinion argued many population figure resultarbitrary formula selectively applied number unreliable
historical source deficiency see unrecognizedseveral contributor field belief enough
solid evidence produce population number real
meaning characterizes modern trend high estimate 
pseudoscientific numbercrunching henige doe advocate low
population estimate rather argues scanty unreliable
nature evidence render broad estimate suspect high
counter call particularly flagrantmisuse sourcesalthough heniges criticism directedspecific instance study generally acknowledgeinherent difficulty producing reliable statistic given almost
complete lack hard data period question

population debate often ideological underpinnings low
estimate sometimes reflective european notioncultural racial superiority historian francis jenningsargued scholarly wisdom long held indian inferiormind work could possibly created sustained

since civilization rose fell america columbus

population area america reached low pointearly twentieth century number case started climb

depopulation disease

earliest european immigrant offered two principal explanationpopulation decline american native first wabrutal practice spanish conquistador recordedspanish notably dominican friar bartolom la casas whose writing vividly depict atrocity committednative spanish second explanation religious godremoved native part divine plan order make waynew christian civilization many native america also
understood trouble term religious supernatural causes
scholar believe among various contributing factors
epidemic disease overwhelming cause population decline
american natives

disease began kill immense number indigenous american soon
european african began arrive new world bringing
infectious disease old world one reasondeath toll overlooked downplayed disease accordingwidely held theory raced ahead european immigration many
area thus often killing sizable portion population
european observation thus written record made many
european immigrant arrived epidemic already killed
massive number american native assumed native always
number scope epidemic yearenormous killing million peoplein excess ofof population
hardest hit areasand creating greatest human catastrophe
history far exceeding even disaster black deathmedieval europe

devastating disease smallpox deadly diseases
included typhus measles influenza bubonic plague mumps yellow
fever whooping cough america also endemic diseases
perhaps including type syphilis soon became rampantold world transfer disease old new worldpart phenomenon known thecolumbian exchangedisease brought new world proved exceptionally deadly

epidemic different effect different partamerica vulnerable group relatively small
population many island based group utterly annihilatedcarib arawak caribbean nearly ceased existbeothuks newfoundland disease ranged swiftlydensely populated empire mesoamerica scattered
population north america saw slower spread

disease deadly

disease viral bacterial kill victimspread others tends flare die like fire
running fuel resilient disease would establishequilibrium victim living well beyond infection spread
disease function evolutionary process selectsquick lethality immediately fatal diseaseshortlived similar evolutionary pressure act upon victim
population lacking genetic resistance common disease die
leave descendant whereas resistant procreate
pas resistant gene offspring

thus disease population tend evolve towardsequilibrium common disease nonsymptomatic mildmanageably chronic population relatively isolated
exposed new disease inborn resistance new
disease population biologically nave body people
succumbs much higher rate resulting known virgin
soil epidemic european arrival americaisolated eurasianafrican landmass people old
world thousand year accommodate common
disease native america faced
contributing factors
native american medical treatment sweat bath cold
water immersion practiced area weakened patientprobably increased mortality rates
european brought many deadly diseasemany domesticated animal native americans
domestication usually mean close frequent contactanimal people opportunity diseasedomestic animal mutate migrate human population

colder area eurasian landmass house often
built two story bottom story used stable
animal top house human winter animal heat
would rise warm human section housearrangement efficient also contributes disease

eurasian landmass extends many thousand mile alongeastwest axis climate zone also extend thousand miles
facilitated spread agriculture domesticationanimal disease associated domesticationamerica extend mainly north south accordingtheory popularized jared diamond gun germ steel

domesticated animal disease spread
one contemporary scientist rodolfo acuasoto arguesmortality due imported disease compounded even dwarfed
mortality due hemorrhagic fever native americas
call cocoliztli claim fever endemic
year drought early year spanish
invasion central america acuasotos theory controversial
widely accepted

deliberate infection

one contentious issue relating disease depopulation
america concern degree american indigenous
people intentionally infected disease smallpox
despite legend contrary seems evidence
spanish ever attempted deliberately infect american
natives

however least one documented incident british
soldier north america attempted intentionally infect native
people pontiac rebellion ina number native
american launched widespread war british soldiersettler attempt drive british great lakes
region western pennsylvania native americans
primarily delaware laid siege fort pitt june

british general jeffrey amherst usually associatedincident although suggested tactic lettersubordinate time commander fort pitt already made
attempt certain officer attemptedintentionally infect american indian smallpox uncertain
whether attempt successful many nativearea died smallpox insome writer concludedattempt indeed success number recent scholar however

cause depopulation

war violence

epidemic disease far leading cause population
decline american indigenous people aftertherecontributing factor related european contactcolonization one factor warfare accordingdemographer russell thornton although many life lost wars
century war sometimes contributed near
extinction certain tribe warfare death violent means
wa comparatively minor cause overall native population decline

disagreement among scholar widespread warfare
wa precolumbian america general agreement war
became deadlier arrival european europeans
brought gunpowder steel weapon made killing
easier war deadly long run european provedconsistently successful achieving domination engaged warfare
indigenous american variety reason longdebated massive death disease certainly played roleeuropean conquest also decisive european approach war
wa ritualistic native america focusedachieving decisive victory european colonization also contributedincreased number war displaced native groups

addition empire like inca depended centralized
administration distribution resource disruption caused
war colonization certainly disrupted traditional
economy possibly led shortage food materials

exploitation

exploitation also cited cause native american
depopulation spanish conquistador first settler new
world divided conquered land among ruled feudal
lord treating subject something slave serfs

latin america well century past independencesometimes said existed practice much century large number landless labourer nearly tied
estate semifeudal arrangements

massacres

intended provoke moral outrage order facilitate reformscholar speculate depiction may exaggerateddegree mainstream scholar dismisses idea atrocities
widespread believe mass killingsignificant factor overall native depopulation may argued

genocide debate

controversial question relating population history american
indigenous people whether native americavictim genocide naziperpetrated holocaustworld war genocide defined part crime committedintent destroy whole part national ethnical racialreligious group
historian david stannard opinion indigenous peoples
america including hawaiiwere victim euroamerican
genocidal war conceding majority indigenous

stannards perspective joined kirkpatrick sale ben

mainstream historian denies death sufferingunjustly inflicted number european upon great many american
native many argue genocide crime intent waintent european colonization historian stafford poole wrote

therefore mainstream scholar tend use term genocide
