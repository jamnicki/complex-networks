habitability

gas giant planet located liquid water habitable zone
mu arae would prevent earthlike planet forminghabitable zone however large moon gas giant could potentially
support liquid water hand unclear whethermassive moon could actually form around gas giant planet thanksapparent scaling law mass planetsatellite system addition measurement star ultraviolet
flux suggest potentially habitable planet moon mayreceive enough ultraviolet trigger formation biomolecules

planet would receive similar amount ultraviolet earth
thus lie ultraviolet habitable zone however wouldhot moon support surface liquid water
