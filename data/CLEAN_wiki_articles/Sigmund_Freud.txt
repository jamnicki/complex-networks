unconscious

ha often claimed significant contribution freud
made western thought argument existenceunconscious mind century dominant trendwestern thought positivism subscribed beliefpeople could ascertain real knowledge concerningenvironment judiciously exercise control freud however
suggested declaration free fact delusions
entirely aware think often actreason little conscious thought concept
unconscious proposed freud allegedly groundbreakingproposed awareness existed layerthought occurring surface nevertheless psychologist
jacques van rillaer among others pointed contrarypeople believe unconscious discovered freud 
psychoanalysis still unheard william jamesmonumental treatise psychology examined way schopenhauer von
hartmann janet binet others used term unconscioussubconscious moreover historian psychology mark altschule
writes difficultor perhaps impossibleto find nineteenth
century psychologist medical psychologist recognize
unconscious cerebration real highest
importance

dream called royal road unconscious provided
best access unconscious life best illustrationlogic different logic conscious thought
freud developed first topology psyche interpretation
dreamsin proposed argument unconscious
exists described method gaining accesspreconscious described layer conscious unconscious
thoughtthat could access little effort thusfreud ideal enlightenment positivism rationalism
could achieved understanding transforming mastering
unconscious rather denying repressing
crucial operation unconscious isrepression according
freud people often experience thought feelingpainful people cannot bear thought feelingsand
associated memoriescould freud argued banished mind
could banished consciousness thus come constitute
unconscious although freud later attempted find patternrepression among patient order derive general modelmind also observed individual patient repress different
thing moreover freud observed process repressionnonconscious act word occurpeople willing away certain thought feeling freud supposedpeople repressed part determined unconsciousword unconscious freud cause effectrepression

later freud distinguished three concept unconscious
descriptive unconscious dynamic unconscious system
unconscious descriptive unconscious referred features
mental life subjectively aware dynamic
unconscious specific construct referred mental processcontent defensively removed consciousness result
conflictual force dynamic system unconscious denotedidea mental process repressed become organizedprinciple different conscious mindcondensation displacement

eventually freud abandoned idea system unconscious
replacing concept ego superego discussed
throughout career however retained descriptivedynamic conception unconscious

psychosexual development

freud also believed libido developed individualchanging object process designed concept sublimation
argued human born polymorphously perverse meaningnumber object could source pleasure argued
human develop become fixated different specific
object stage developmentfirst oral stage
exemplified infant pleasure nursing anal
stage exemplified toddler pleasure emptyingbowel phallic stage freud argued childpassed stage fixated mother sexual
object known oedipus complex child eventually
overcame repressed desire taboo naturelesser known electra complex refers fixation uponfather repressive dormant latency stage psychosexual
development preceded sexually mature genital stage psychosexual
development

freud hoped prove model universally valid thus
turned ancient mythology contemporary ethnographycomparative material freud named new theory oedipus complex
famous greek tragedy oedipus rex sophocles foundconstant love mother jealousy fatherconsider universal event childhood freud said freud
sought anchor pattern development dynamicmind stage progression adult sexual maturity
characterized strong ego ability delay gratification
cf three essay theory sexuality used oedipus
conflict point much believed people desire incest
must repress desire oedipus conflict describedstate psychosexual development awareness also turnedanthropological study totemism argued totemism reflected
ritualized enactment tribal oedipal conflict

freud originally posited childhood sexual abuse general
explanation origin neurosis abandoned socalled
seduction theory insufficiently explanatory notingfound many case apparent memory childhood sexual abuse
based imagination real event late
freud never abandoned belief sexual etiologyneurosis began emphasize fantasy built around oedipus complex
primary cause hysteria neurotic symptom despite
change explanatory model freud always recognizedneurotic sexually abused father quite
explicit discussing several patient knewabusedgayp

freud way interpretation called phallocentric many
contemporary thinker freud unconscious
always desire phallus penis male afraid castration 
losing phallus masculinity another male female always
desire phallusan unfulfillable desire thus boy resent
father fear castration girl desire freud
desire always defined negative term lackyou always
desire dont unlikely
fulfill desire thus psychoanalysis treatmentmeant teach patient cope unsatisfiable desires

ego superego 
later work freud proposed psyche dividedthree part ego superego freud discussed structural
model mind theessay beyond pleasure principlefully elaborated ego idwhere developedalternative previous topographic schema conscious
unconscious preconscious

defense mechanisms

according freud defense mechanism methodego solve conflict superego use
defense mechanism may attenuate conflict idsuperego overuse reuse rather confrontationlead either anxiety guilt may result psychological
disorder depression daughter anna freud donesignificant work field yet credited sigmund defense
mechanism began work defense mechanism include
denial reaction formation displacement repression suppressionproper term projection intellectualisation rationalisation
compensation sublimation regressive emotionality
denial occurs someone fends awareness unpleasant
truth reality threat ego examplestudent may received bad grade report card tells
grade dont matter early writer arguedstriking parallel freudian denial nietzsche idearessentiment revaluation value attributedherd slave morality
reaction formation take place person take opposite
approach consciously compared person wants
unconsciously example someone may engage violenceanother race person claim member race
inferior unconsciously person feels
inferior
displacement take place someone redirects emotiondangerous object safe one punching pillowone angry friend
repression occurs experience painful war
trauma unconsciously forced consciousnesssuppression conscious effortpsychological projection occurs person projectundesirable thought motivation desire feeling 
basically part oneselfonto someone something elseexample would say alice doesnt like bobrather admit doesnt like bob projectsentiment onto bob saying bob doesnt likeintellectualisation involves removing one self emotionallystressful event intellectualisation often accomplished
rationalisation rather accepting reality one may
explain way remove one self
rationalization involves constructing logical justificationdecision originally arrived different mental
process example jim may bought tape player listen
selfhelp tape tell friend boughtlisten classic rock mix fear actual reason
rejected
compensation occurs someone take one behaviour one
cannot accomplish another behaviour example second born
child may clown around get attention since older childalready accomplished scholar
sublimation channeling impulse socially accepted
behaviour instance use dark gloomy poemdescribe life poet emily dickinson

freud legacy

psychotherapy

freud theory research method controversiallife remain today dispute farreaching impactpsychologist academics

importantly freud popularized talkingcurethe notionperson could treated simply talking problems
wa almost unheard century even though many
psychotherapist today partly wholly reject specific freuds
theory basic model treatment stem largely work

addition freud development unconscious source behavior
emphasis motivational structure human mindlasting impact psychological theory research howeverfreud specific theorieslike stage psychosexual
developmentand especially methodology fallen favour
modern experimental psychology

psychotherapist however still follow approximately freudian
system treatment many modified approach joined
one school branched original theory see
neofreudian still others reject theory entirely although
practice may still reflect influence

psychoanalysis today maintains ambivalent relationshipmedicine academia freud experienced life

philosophy

freud saw scientist theorytremendous impact humanitiesespecially frankfurt school
critical theory addition many philosopher discussedtheory implication broader context western
thought freud model mind often seen critical
challenge enlightenment model rational agency wakey element much modern philosophy
rationality many enlightenment thinker viewed rationality
unproblematic ideal defining feature man
freud model mind drastically reduced scope power
reason freud view reasoning occurs conscious
mindthe egobut small part whole mind
also contains hidden irrational element superego
lie outside conscious control drive behaviourmotivate conscious activity result structure call
question human ability act purely basis reason
since lurking motif also always play moreover model
mind make rationality suspect since maymotivated hidden urge societal force defense
mechanism reasoning becomes rationalizing

transparency self another common assumption prefreudian
philosophy people immediate unproblematic access
emblematic position ren descartess
famous line cogito ergo sum think thereforehowever freud many central aspect person remain
radically inaccessible conscious mind without aidpsychotherapy undermines unquestionable statusfirstperson knowledge

pop culture

freud also remarkably powerful lasting impact popular
culture many general psychological idea made way
people everyday thinkingfor example idea someonemotivated unconscious impulse general idea man
contains beast within restrained institutionsociety specific idea alsopopularizedfreudian slip oedipal complex anal
personality trait example frequently mentionednontechnical discourse

since early freud idea often represented
explicitly implicitly wide variety art literaturefilm small sampling famous artistic figure famousfreudian overtone would include alfred hitchcock thomas mannmany others

critical reactions

although freud theory quite influential also come
widespread criticism lifetime afterward paper

critic rather attacking body freud workdelved individual topic instance juliet mitchellsuggested freud basic claimthat many conscious
thought action driven unconscious desire fear 
rejected implicitly challenge possibilitymaking universal objective claim world proponents
science conclude invalidates freudian theory meaninterpreting explaining human behaviour

another frequently criticized aspect freud theory model
psychosexual development attacked freud claiminfant sexual implicitly freud expanded notionsexuality others accepted freud expanded notion sexuality
argued pattern development universalnecessary development healthy adult insteademphasized social environmental source patterndevelopment moreover call attention social dynamic freud
deemphasized ignored class relation branchfreudian critique owes great deal work herbert marcuse

freud also come fire many feminist critic freud waearly champion sexual freedom education woman freud

finally freud theory often criticized real
