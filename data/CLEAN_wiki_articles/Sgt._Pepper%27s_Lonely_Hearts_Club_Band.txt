sgt pepper lonely heart club band recorded early beatlemania
wa waning beatles grown tired touring quitroad lateburned drama thebiggerjesus controversy tumultuous tour philippine saw
band expelled country gunpoint

retirement touring gave first time career
ample time prepare next record emis
premier act britain successful pop group everalmost unlimited access stateoftheart technology abbey
road studio four band member already developed preference
long latenight session although still extremely
efficient highly disciplined studio habits

time beatles recorded album musical interestgrown simple blue pop rock beginning incorporatevariety new influence become familiar wide range
instrument hammond organ electric pianoinstrumentation covered entire range including string brass
woodwind percussion wide range exotic instrument including
sitar paul mccartney although unable read music scoredrecent british film family way assistanceproducerarranger george martin earned prestigious ivor
novello award

beatles also used new modular effect unit like wahwah pedal
fuzzbox augmented experimental
idea running voice instrument leslie speaker
another important sonic innovation mccartney discoverydirect injection technique could record bassplugging directly amplifying circuit recording
console still oftenused technique recordingamplifier microphone sound natural setup providedradically different presence bass guitar sound versus old
method

sgt pepper period also coincided introductionimportant musical innovation within band rest
musical industry work bob dylan frank zappa phil
spector brian wilson radically redefining possible
pop musician term songwriting recording studio
recording technology already reached high degreedevelopment poised even greater innovation old rules
pop songwriting abandoned complex lyrical themeexplored first time popular music song growing
longer dylansdesolation rowlike rolling stonelike tom thumb blues

technical innovation

since introduction core technology magnetic recording
tape inmultitrack recording progressed rapidly track
tape recorder already available usa first tracks
coming online commercial studio london lateshortly
sgt pepper released

sgt pepper track recorded abbey road using mono
stereo track recorder like predecessor recording made
extensive use technique known bouncingnumber track recorded across four track one recorder
mixed dubbed onto one track master
track machine enabled abbey road engineer givebeatles virtual multitrack studio sinceand track
recorder exist time

buildup noise repeated dubbing major problemengineer abbey road album one first use dolby
noise reduction system album remains landmark historysound recording remarkable clarity fidelityquietness transfers

magnetic tape also led innovative use instrumentproduction effect notably tapebased keyboard samplermellotron effect like flanging term invented martineffect used early ason toni fisher big hurtphasing greatly improved system creating echoreverberation

several thennew production effect feature extensivelyrecording one important automatic double tracking
adt system used tape recorder create instantsimultaneous doubling sound although long recognised
using multitrack tape record doubled lead vocal gavegreatly enhanced sound especially weaker singer always
necessary record vocal track twice task watedious exacting

adt invented specially beatles emi engineer ken
townshend inmainly behest lennon hated tracking
session regularly expressed desire technical solutionproblem adt quickly became nearuniversal recording practicepopular music

also important varispeeding technique recording various
track multitrack tape slightly different tape speedbeatles use effect extensively vocal periodspeeding vocal also known tweaking also becamewidespread technique pop production beatles also usedeffect portion backing track onlucy sky
diamond give thicker diffuse sound

another innovation album original formlater released end unusual way beginningkilohertz highfrequency tone put album john lennons
suggestion said especially intended annoy dog
followed endless loop made runout groove looping back
sound loop also subject much controversywidely interpreted kind secret message however seems
reality nothing random sample tape
edits played backwards loop recreated versionplay second fade although content
runout groove impossible decipher possibledistinguish spedup voice possibly paul mccartney recitingphrase never could see way

instrumentation

sgt pepper feature elaborate arrangementsfor example clarinet
ensemble onwhen sixtyfourand extensive use studio
effect including echo reverberation reverse tape effect manyeffect devised collaboration producer george martin
team engineers

one moment discord came recording ofshes
leaving home impatient mccartney frustrated martins
unavailability another recording session hired freelance arranger
mike leander arrange string sectionthe timegroup entire career worked another arrangerexception backing orchestration used magical mystery
tour filmoctobersession see lewisohn also
arranged leander

another example album unusual production john lennon song
benefit kite close sideof album
lyric adapted almost word word old circus poster
lennon bought antique shop kent flowing sound
collage give song distinctive character createdmartin engineer collected recording calliopefairground organ cut strip various lengths
thrown box mixed edited together random order
creating long loop mixed final production

opening track sidewithin without unusually
long pop recording day feature george
harrison vocal sitar instrument played
group londonbased indian musician deviationtraditional rock roll band formula facilitated beatles
decision tour ability hire toprate session
musician harrison burgeoning interest india indian
music led take lesson sitar maestro ravi shankar

mono version

beatles mixed album mono lporiginally released alongside stereo mix prepared abbey
road engineer mono version outofprint vinylnever released two mix fundamentally differentexample stereo shes leaving home mixed lower pitch
original recording play slower tempo similarlymono version lucy sky diamond considerably slower
stereo version feature much heavier gating reverb
effect mccartney yelling voice coda section sgt pepper
reprise segue intoa day lifeplainly heard mono version inaudible stereo
version mono version song also feature drum open
much presence force turned wellmix also stereo mix famous segue end ofgood
morning good morning chickenclucking sound becomesguitar noise timed differently crowd noise tape comelater intro sgt pepper reprise variations
two mix abound

theme structure

sgt pepper beatles wanted create record couldeffect tour theman idea already exploredpromotional filmclips made previous year intendedpromote united state touring
mccartney decided create fictitious characterband member record album would performancefictitious band idea disguise change identityone beatles naturally enough avid interestthey
four recognisable widely known individualth century

beatles recognizability motivation growing
moustache beard even longer hair inspirationdisguise flamboyant sgt pepper costume mccartneywell known going public disguise four used
alias travel booking hotel reservations

thus album start title song introduces sgt
pepper band song segue seamlessly sung
introduction bandleader billy shear starr performswith
little help friend reprise version title songalso recorded appears sideof original album prior
climactic day life creating bookending effect

however beatles essentially abandoned concept recording
first two song reprise lennon unequivocal stating
song wrote album nothing sgt
pepper concept since song album actually
unrelated one might tempted conclude album doeform overarching theme however cohesive structure careful
sequencing transitioning song album welluse sgt pepper framing device led albumwidely acknowledged early groundbreaking exampleconcept album
