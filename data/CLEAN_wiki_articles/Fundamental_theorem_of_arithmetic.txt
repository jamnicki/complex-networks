applications

fundamental theorem arithmetic establishes importanceprime number prime number basic building blockpositive integer sense positive integerconstructed product prime one unique construction
finding prime factorization integer allows derivationdivisor prime nonprime

example factorization ofshows positive
divisor ofmust form abc take one
thevalues inwhere take one thevaluesc take one thevalues inmultiplying
number independent option together produce totalpositive divisors

prime factorization two number known greatest
common divisor least common multiple found quicklyinstance shown greatest common divisor
ofandishowever prime factorizations
known use euclidean algorithm generally requires
much calculation factoring two numbers

fundamental theorem ensures additive multiplicative
arithmetic function completely determined valuepower prime numbers

proof

theorem essentially first proved euclid first full
correct proof found disquisitiones arithmeticae carl
friedrich gauss

although first sight theorem seems obvious doe hold
general number system including many ring algebraic
integer first pointed ernst kummer ininwork fermat last theorem recognition failure one
earliest development algebraic number theory

euclid proof

proof consists two step first step every numbershown product zero prime second proof
show two representation may unified single
representation

nonprime composite numbers

suppose positive integer cannot writtenproduct prime must smallest number letn number cannot bebecause conventioncannot prime number either since prime number productsingle prime must composite number thus

nab

b positive integer smaller since nsmallest number cannot written product primeb written product prime
nab

written product prime well contradictionminimal counterexample argument

proof infinite descent

proof uniqueness prime factorization given integer
us infinite descent assume certain integer writtenleast two different product prime number must
exist smallest integer property denote two

gives

value side equation obviously smallerstill large enough factorizable since smallerp two prime factorization get side kr written product prime must differentcontradiction smallest integer factorizableone way thus original assumption must false

proof using abstract algebra

let integer finite group therefore hacomposition series definition factor composition series
simple hence factor composition series znform prime number since order znproduct order factor composition seriesgive factorization prime number jordanhlder
theorem say composition series unique hence prime
factorization must unique
