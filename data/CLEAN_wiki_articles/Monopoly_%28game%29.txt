dealing bargaining

much skill come knowing make best useplayer resource knowing strike good bargain
monopoly social game player often interact must deal
way unlike real world real estate bargaining
note best deal always expensive property
often situational dependent money resource availableplayer even player happen situated boardlooking deal player attempt bargain another player
posse property need also propertyplayer need themself fact offering relatively fair dealplayer end helping player making offer giving
reputation honest broker make players
le wary dealing future people play
monopoly group repeatedly reasonreputation effect far beyond game played

end game

one common criticism monopoly carefully defined yet
almost unreachable termination condition edward parker former
president parker brother quoted saying always feltfortyfive minute right length game monopoly
could hour also game supposed definite end
somewhere monopoly kept going around around howeverproblem time resolved playing time limitcounting player net worth time fact
tournament play call minute time limit two hour time limits
used international play lord ring edition gives
player option creating random time limit using included
one ring token specialized dice

played strictly rule many game effectively decided
one player succeeds bankrupting another bankrupt
player give property one could paydebt player thus gain fistful property virtually
control game point onwards since playerconstantly risk hand player bankruptedunable meet debt bank fine taxdebt rent property auctionedopen new possibility game evenly setlot property set divided among players

another path faster ending key property bargain whether
shrewd trade set one playerwellpositioned set rash trade inexperienced player
give experienced opponent underpriced gem either way deal
pay one player often turning pointgame

third way finish game though fastest jotimportant information like property money space pieceput box game finish later date
