similarly human colour perception generated mixture

primary colour printing systems
generally pure color reproduced never
perfectly saturated color spectral color cannot matched
exactly however natural scene rarely contain fully saturated colors
thus scene usually approximated well systemrange color reproduced given colour reproduction
system called gamut cie chromaticity diagram useddescribe gamut

another problem color reproduction system connectedacquisition device like camera scanner characteristiccolour sensor device often farcharacteristic receptor human eye effect
acquisition color special often jagged
spectrum caused example unusual lighting photographed
scene relatively poor

specie colour receptor different human g birds
may four receptor differentiate color look
human case color reproduction system tuned
human normal colour vision may give inaccurate results
observers

next problem different color response different devicecolour information stored transferred digital form colour
management technique based colour profile attached color data
device different colour response help avoid
