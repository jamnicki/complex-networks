new circulatory model

many believe servetus descartes merely rediscoveredextended early muslim medicine especially work ibn nafislaid principle major artery vein century

fabricius harvey teacher padua claimed discovery valves
vein discovered true use explanation
put forward satisfy harvey thus became
harvey endeavour explain true use valveeventually search suggested larger questionexplanation motion blood harvey announced discoverycirculatory system inand inpublished work
exercitatio anatomica motu cordis sanguinis animalibusanatomical exercise motion heart blood animals
based scientific methodology argued ideablood pumped around body heart returningheart recirculated closed system

clashed accepted model going back galenidentified venous dark red arterial brighter thinner blood
distinct separate function venous blood thoughtoriginate liver arterial blood heart blood
flowed organ part bodyconsumed exactly reason work ibn nafis
ignored

harvey based conclusion careful observation recorded
vivisection made various animal controlled
experiment first person study biology quantitativelyexperiment see much blood would pas heart
day experiment used estimate capacityheart much blood expelled pump heartamount time heart beat half hourestimate purposly low people could see vast
amount blood needed produced day liverestimated capacity heart wasounces every
time heart pumpsof blood expelled ledharvey estimate aboutof ounce blood wentheart every time pumped next estimate used waheart beatstimes every half hour gavepounds 
ounce blood half hour number multiplied
byhalf hour day realized liver wouldproducepounds blood day time common thoughtblood recycled constantly produced

proposed blood flowed heart two separate closed
loop one loop pulmonary circulation connected circulatory
system lung second loop systemic circulation causes
blood flow vital organ body tissue also observed
blood vein would move readily towards heart veins
would allow flow opposite direction observedanother simple experiment harvey tied tight ligature onto upper
arm person would cut bloodflow arteryvein done arm ligature coolpale ligature warm swollen ligature
wa loosened slightly allowed blood artery come
arm since artery deeper flesh veins
wa done opposite effect seen lower armwa warm swollen vein also visible sincefull blood harvey noticed little bump veins
realized valve vein discoveredearlier biologist hieronymus fabricius harvey tried push bloodvein arm avail tried pusharm moved quite easily effect seen veinbody except vein neck vein differentothersthey allow blood flowled harvey believe vein allowed blood flowheart valve maintained one way flow harveyconcluded heart acted like pump forced blood move
throughout body instead prevailing theory dayblood flow caused sucking action heart liverimportant theory harvey represent two significant contributionunderstanding mechanism circulation

harvey also became lumleian lecturer royal collegephysician

even harvey work little effect general medical practicetimeblood letting based prevailing galenic tradition
