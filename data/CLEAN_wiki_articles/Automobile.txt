driver make mistake wheel lose traction braking
turning force high vehicle high centregravity therefore increased tendency roll driven
high speed collision serious even fatal consequence

early safety research focused increasing reliability brakes

proximity obstacle vehicle front carusing apply brake collision inevitable
also limited effort use head displaythermal imaging technology similar used military aircraft
provide driver better view road night

standard test safety new automobile likeeuroncap ncap test also test runorganization iihs backed insurance industry

despite technological advance still significant loss life
car accident aboutpeople die every year similar figure europe figure increase annually step
rising population increasing travel measure taken
rate per caput per mile travelled decrease steadilydeath toll expected nearly double worldwide bya much
higher number accident result injury permanent disability
highest accident figure reported china indiaeuropean union rigid program cut death toll euhalf byand member state started implementing measures
