craton kratos greek strength old stable partcontinental crust survived merging splittingcontinent supercontinents leastmillion yearoverbillion year old craton generally found interiors

term craton used distinguish stable interior portioncontinental crust region mobile geosynclinal troughs
linear belt sediment accumulation subject subsidence
downwarping extensive central craton continent may consist
shield platform crystalline basement shield
part craton usually precambrian basement
rock crop extensively surface contrast platformbasement overlain horizontal subhorizontal sediments

craton subdivided geographically geologic provincegeologic province spatial entity common geologic attributes
