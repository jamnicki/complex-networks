mosaic technique

three main method direct method indirect method
double indirect method

direct method

direct method mosaic construction involves directly placing
gluing individual tessera onto supporting surfacemethod well suited surface threedimensional
quality vases

direct method suit small project transportable another
advantage direct method resulting mosaicprogressively visible allowing adjustment tile colors
placement

disadvantage direct method artist must work
directly chosen surface often practical long
period time unsuitable large scale project alsodifficult control evenness finished surfaceparticular importance creating functional surfacefloor table top

modern version direct method sometimes called double
direct work directly onto fibreglass mesh mosaicconstructed design visible surface transported
final location large work done waymosaic cut shipping reassembled installation
enables artist work comfort studio rathersite installation

indirect method

indirect method applying tessera often used large
project repetitive element tile applied upsidedownadhesive backing paper later transferred onto wall floorcraft project method useful mosaic simplegeometric pattern solid block colour extremely large
project mosaic tabletop usually made using indirect method
result smoother even surface

double indirect method

double indirect method often used important see
work creation process appear completed
tessera placed faceup medium often adhesivebacked
paper sticky plastic appear installedmosaic complete similar medium placed atop pieceturned original underlaying material removedpiece installed indirect method described
indirect doubleindirect method often performedsection allowing extremely large project muralcompleted offsite transported destination without large
truck needed

mathematics

best way arrange variously shaped tile surface leadcomplicated mathematical problemssee tessellation detail roger
penrose mathematician worked tiling problemssee
penrose tilings

artist escher influenced moorish mosaic begininvestigation tessellation

digital imaging

mosaic digital imaging plurality nonoverlapping images
arranged tessellation photomosaic picture madevarious picture pioneered joseph francis 
pixel actually another picture examined closely

tile mosaic digital image made individual tile arranged
nonoverlapping fashion make static image shower
room bathing pool floor breaking image square
pixel formed ceramic tile typical size isinch byinch
example floor university toronto pool though
sometimes larger tile asbyinch used digital
image coarse resolution often simply express textdepth pool various place digital images
used show sunset beach theme obviously digital
image expressed ceramic tile low resolution
