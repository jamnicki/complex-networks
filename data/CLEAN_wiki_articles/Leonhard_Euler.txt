contribution mathematics

euler worked almost area mathematics geometry calculus
trigonometry algebra number theory mention continuum
physic lunar theory area physic importancehistory mathematics cannot overstated printed works

mathematical notation

euler introduced popularized several notational conventionnumerous widely circulated textbook notablyintroduced concept function first write fxdenote function applied argument also introducedmodern notation trigonometric function letter ebase natural logarithm also known euler numbergreek letterfor summation letter denote imaginary
unit use greek letterto denote ratio circles

addition euler elaborated theory higher transcendental
function introducing gamma function introduced new method
solving quartic equation also found way calculate
integral complex limit foreshadowing development modern
complex analysis invented calculus variation includingwellknown result eulerlagrange equation

euler also pioneered use analytic method solve number theory

number theory

euler great interest number theory traced influence
friend peterburg academy christian goldbach lot
early work number theory based work pierre fermat developed fermat idea disprovingoutlandish conjectures

idea analysis proved sum reciprocalprime diverges discovered connectionriemann zeta function prime number known euler product
formula riemann zeta function

euler proved newton identity fermat little theorem fermats
theorem sum two square made distinct contributionlagranges foursquare theorem also invented totient function
n assigns positive integer number positive

significantly understanding perfect numberfascinated mathematician since euclid euler made progress towardprime number theorem conjectured law quadratic reciprocity

technique celestial problem work astronomyrecognized number paris academy prize coursecareer accomplishment include determining great accuracyorbit comet celestial body understanding nature
comet calculating parallax sun calculations
also contributed development accurate longitude tables

addition euler made important contribution optic disagreed
