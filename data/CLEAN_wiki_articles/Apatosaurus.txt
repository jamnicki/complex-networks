paleobiology

early believed apatosaurus massive support
weight dry land theorized sauropod must
lived partly submerged water perhaps swamp recent
finding support fact like relative diplodocus
apatosaurus grazing animal long neck long tail
served counterweight fossilized footprint indicateprobably lived herd aid processing food apatosaurus may
swallowed gizzard stonesgastroliths way many
bird today jaw lacked molar chew tough
plant fibers

neck

apatosaurus browsed top tree riverbank scientists
believe sauropod could raise neck angledegree would slow blood flow brain excessively
blood starting body proper would take two minutereach brain furthermore study structure neck
vertebra revealed neck flexible previously
thought

physiology

large body mass combined long neck physiologists
encounter problem determining animal managed breathe

beginning assumption apatosaurus like crocodiliandiaphragm deadspace volume amount unused air
remaining mouth trachea air tube breathestimated aboutliters specimen

tidal volume amount air moved single
breath calculated based following respiratory systems
liter avian
liter mammalian
liter reptilian

basis respiratory system could reptiliantidal volume would able replace deadspace
volume likewise mammalian system would provide fractionnew air breath therefore must either system
unknown modern world one like bird multiple air sacs
flowthrough lung

furthermore avian system would need lung volume 
liter compared mammalian requirement ofliters would
exceed available space overall thoracic volume apatosaurus
ha estimated atliters allowing liter
fourchambered heart like bird threechambered like reptiles
liter lung capacity would allow aboutlitersnecessary tissue

assuming apatosaurus avian respiratory system reptilian
restingmetabolism certainly could fly would needconsume aboutlitersgallons water per day

known apatosaur ate enough food satisfyenormous body likely ate constantly pausingcool drink remove parasite surmised slept
standing upright likely relied enormous size herd
behaviour deter predators

lips

according robert bakker major possibility apatosaurus
may thick mooselike lips
