januaryto julythe largescale production plantset operation fissile material thus produced used
determine feature weapon multipronged researchundertaken follow several angle attack problembomb design early decision weapon design basedminute quantity uraniumenriched uranium plutonium
created pilot plant laboratory cyclotron results
wa thought creation bomb simple shooting
one piece fissile material another form critical mass

production uranium proved quite difficultexisting technology production plutonium comparatively
easier byproduct specially constructed nuclear
reactor first developed enrico fermireactorgrade plutonium however considerably purecyclotronproduced plutonium presence another isotopeplutonium resulting product meant simple gun type
model bomb design would work presence extra neutrons
meant weapon would predetonate greatly reduced yield
problem discovered inled redesignplutonium bomb towards idea implosion spherical
core plutonium would compressed using conventional explosives
would increase density thus create critical mass

problem construct weapon would precisely
compress plutonium sphere side exactly equallyany error
would result fizzle would simply eject valuable
plutonium result large explosiondifficulty creating explosive lens perfect compression
using existing technology decided manhattan project
military leader general leslie grove scientific director robert
oppenheimer test concept would undertaken
weapon could confidently used war conditions
