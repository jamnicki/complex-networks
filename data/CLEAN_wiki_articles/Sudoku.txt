scanning

scanning performed outset throughout solution scans
need performed analysis scanning consists
two techniques
crosshatching scanning row identify lineregion may contain certain numeral process elimination
process repeated column fastest resultnumeral scanned order frequency high low
important perform process systematically checking
digit 
countingin region row column identify missing
numeral counting based upon last numeral discovered may speed
search also case particularly tougher
puzzle best way ascertain value cellcount reversethat scanning cell region rowcolumn value cannot order see remains

advanced solver look contingency scanning narrowingnumeral location within row column region two three
cell cell lie within row regionused elimination crosshatching counting puzzle solved
scanning alone without requiring detection contingencyclassified easy difficult puzzle cannot solved basic

analysis

two main approach analysis candidate eliminationwhatif candidate elimination progress made successively
eliminating candidate numeral cell leave one choiceanswer achieved another scan may performedusually
checking see effect contingency generalentering particular numeral prevents completionnecessary placement numeral question eliminatedcandidate one method work identifying matched cell groupinstance precisely two cell within scope particular row

computer solutions

two general approach taken creation serious

humanstyle solver typically operate maintaining markup
matrix search contingency matched cell elements
human solver utilize order determine exclude cell

difficulty ratings

difficulty puzzle based relevancepositioning given number rather quantity
surprisingly number given doe always reflect puzzles
difficulty computer solver estimate difficulty humanfind solution based complexity solving techniques
required online version offer several difficulty levels

publication sort sudoku puzzle four five rating
level although actual cutoff point name levels
vary widely typically however title synonyms
