classification

much work vegetation classification come europeannorth american ecologist fundamentally different
approach north america vegetation type basedcombination following criterion climate pattern plant habit
phenology andor growth form dominant specie current standard adopted federal geographic data committee fgdcoriginally developed unesco nature conservancyclassification hierarchical incorporates nonfloristic
criterion upper general five level limited
floristic criterion lower specific two leveleurope classification often relies much heavily sometimes
entirely floristic specie composition alone without explicit
reference climate phenology growth form often empahsizes
indicator diagnostic specie separate one type another

precisely defined incoporates name dominant

vegetation structure

primary characteristic vegetation threedimensional
structure sometimes referred physiognomy architecture
people understanding ideafamiliarity term like jungle wood prairie meadow
term conjure mental image vegetation looks
like meadow grassy open tropical rainforest dense
tall dark savannah tree dotting grasscovered landscape
etc

obviously forest different structure desertbackyard lawn vegetation ecologist discriminate structure much
detailed level principle thus
different type forest different structure tropical
rainforest different boreal conifer forestdiffer tempeate deciduous forest native grasslandsouth dakota arizona indiana visibly differentlow elevation chaparral differs high elevations
etc

structure determined interacting combination environmental

include thing like fire high wind landslide floods
avalanche like cause usually externalexogenous
