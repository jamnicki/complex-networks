hot air balloon oldest successful human flight technology

paris piltre rozier marquis darlandes hot air
balloon propelled air rathercarried along wind known airship specifically
thermal airships

attractive aspect ballooning include exceptional quiet except
propane burner firing lack perceptible
feeling movement birdseye view since balloon moves
wind passenger feel absolutely wind except brief
period flight balloon climb descends air
current different direction speed

hot air balloon consists bag called envelope capable
containing hot air suspended beneath gondola wicker
basket certain long distance high altitude balloon capsule
carry source heat capable producing sufficient
temperature gradient air inside envelopesurrounding air mass give enough lift keep balloonpassenger aloft unlike gas balloon envelope doesealed bottom since rising hot air exerts pressureupper hemisphere balloon provide lift today sports
