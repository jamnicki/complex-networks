elementary introduction

linear algebra beginning study vector cartesian
space space vector directed line segment
characterized magnitude represented lengthdirection vector used represent physical entityforce added multipliedscalar thus forming first example real vector space

modern linear algebra extended consider space arbitrary
infinite dimension vector space dimension callednspace useful result fromand space extended
higher dimensional space although many people cannot easily
visualize vector nspace vector ntuples usefulrepresenting data since vector ntuples ordered list component possible summarize manipulate data efficiently
framework example economics one create use
say dimensional vector tuples represent gross national
product ofcountries one decide display gnp 
country particular year country orderspecified example united state united kingdom france
germany spain india japan australia using vector v v v v country gnprespective position

vector space linear space purely abstract conceptprove theorem part abstract algebra well
integrated discipline striking examplegroup invertible linear map matrix ring linear
map vector space linear algebra also play important partanalysis notably description higher order derivativevector analysis study tensor product alternating maps
