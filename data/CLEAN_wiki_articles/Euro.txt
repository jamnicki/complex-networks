transaction cost risks

obvious benefit adopting single currency removingtrade cost exchanging currency theoretically allowing
business individual consummate previously unprofitable
trade consumer side bank eurozone must chargeintramember crossborder transaction purely domestic
transaction electronic payment credit card debit cards

risk longer need shoulder additional cost
reduction risk particularly important country whose
currency traditionally fluctuated great deal particularlymediterranean nations

financial market continent expected far liquid
flexible past reduction crossborder
transaction cost allow larger banking firm provide wider
array banking service compete across beyondeurozone
