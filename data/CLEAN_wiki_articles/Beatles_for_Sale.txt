amg singled loser one first beatles
composition lyric addressing serious point young
love rowley found obvious copy bob dylanopenly subvert simple true love theme earlier work

although baby black amg described love lamentgrieving girl perhaps morose previous beatles
song mostly lennon work written roommccartney contributed harmony rowley considered track
veer banal sublime thought lyricworldweary sardonic place deliberately awful

mccartney considered beatles sale session beginning
mature phase band got free get
student self rather must pleasegirl make money thankgirl love baby blackliked waltztimeand think also john wantedsomething bluesy bit darker grownup ratherstraight pop

dark theme album balanced mccartney every little
thing celebration wonderful girl guy according

tried one technique another settling eventual
arrangement first six take song featuredstrikingly different approach beginning ending sectionsong eventual chiming guitarbased introduction song
would recorded different session edited later final
version song incorporated another beatle first pop music
rarity song begin fadein counterpoint pop
