usage

touching contact lens one eye importantthoroughly washrinse hand soap doe contain
moisturizers allergen fragrance techniqueremoving inserting contact lens varies slightly depending upon
whether lens soft rigid

insertion

contact lens typically inserted eye placingindex finger convex side upward raising touch
cornea hand may employed keep eye open
problem may arise particularly disposable soft lenssurface tension lens finger great lens
may turn inside alternatively may fold half
lens first contact eye brief period irritation may
ensue eye aclimatises lens also multiuse lens
correctly cleansed dirt lens irritates eye
irrigation may help period generallyexceed one minute

removal

soft lens may removed holding eyelid open graspinglens opposing digit method cause irritation could risk
damage eye may many case difficult part dueblink reflex lens pushed cornea buckle
due difference curvature making easier grasp
