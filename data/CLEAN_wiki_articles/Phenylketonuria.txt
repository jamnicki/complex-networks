history

phenylketonuria discovered norwegian physician ivar asbjrn
flling inwhen noticed hyperphenylalaninemia hpaassociated mental retardation norway disorder known
fllings disease named discoverer flling one
first physician apply detailed chemical analysisstudy disease careful analysis urine two retarded
sibling led request many physician near oslo test urine
retarded patient led discoverysubstance found eight patient substance
found subjected much basic rudimentary chemical
analysis available today conducted test found
reaction gave rise benzaldehyde benzoic acid led
conclude compound contained benzene ring testing
showed melting point phenylpyruvic acidindicated substance urine careful science
inspired many pursue similar meticulous painstaking research
