type oil available

unrefined oil

otherwise known raw oil oil obtained simply
mechanical pressing without treatment apartpossibly filtration raw oil retains compound providedistinctive taste smell marketing purpose raw oil may also
called extra virgin

raw oil extracted crushing pressing copra traditionallyoil obtained grating grinding copra boilingwater

refined oil

various treatment given raw oil produce different
product characteristic hence applications
refined oil virtually tasteless odourless

hydrogenated oil

hydrogenated coconut oil may either fully partially hydrogenated

fractionated oil

fractionated coconut oil fraction whole oillongchain triglyceride removed saturated fats
remain may also referred capryliccapric triglyceridemct oil mostly mediumchain triglyceride capryliccapric acid left oil

completely saturated fractionated oil even heat
stable form coconut oil nearly indefinite

availability consumers

coconut oil widely available country hard
find others generally available big
supermarket easily obtained smaller convenient stores
cheap price fromtofor people unaware
resort buying online health food shopgenerally charge lot fromtofor sellers
explain price saying product refined extra virgin however saturated fat contain double
bond highly heat stable coconut oil 
saturated fat quality oil affected much
processing interestingly enough seller even advertise
product made without heat processingheat stable main difference two oil amount
extra nutrient may remain unrefined oil taste
refined oil nearly nonexistent
