emacs began life mit labintroduction default editor incompatible timesharing system

wa line editor known teco unlike modern text editor teco
treated typing editing document display separate mode like
later would typing character teco placecharacter directly document one write seriesinstruction teco command language telling enterrequired character time edited text wadisplayed screen behaviour similar program still use

richard stallman visited stanford lab inorand saw
lab editor editor intuitive wysiwyg behaviourused almost universally modern text editor impressedfeature stallman returned mit carl mikkelsen onehacker lab added displayediting mode called
controlr teco allowing screen display updatedtime user entered keystroke stallman reimplemented moderun efficiently added macro feature teco displayediting
mode allowing user redefine keystroke run teco
program

new version teco instantly popular lab soon
accumulated large collection custom macro whose names
often ended mac mac stood macro two years
later guy steele took project unifying overly diverse
keyboard command set single set one night joint
hacking steele stallman latter finished implementation
included facility extending documenting new macro
set resulting system called emacs stood editing
macro according stallman picked name emacs wa use abbreviation time alsopointed thatemackbolios name popular ice cream

downside emacs lispbased design performance overhead
resulting loading interpreting lisp code systems
emacs first implemented emacs often noticeably slower
rival text editor several joke acronym allude eight

editing modes

emacs adapts behaviour type text editingentering editing mode called major mode major mode defined
ordinary text file source code many programming languages
html document tex latex document many type text
major mode tweak certain emacs lisp variable make emacs
behave conveniently particular type textparticular usually implement syntax highlighting using different
font color display keywords comment forth major
mode also provide special editing command example major modes
programming language usually define command jumpbeginning end function

behaviour emacs customized using minor modes
one major mode associated buffer time
multiple minor mode simultaneously active examplemajor mode programming language defines different minor
mode popular indent styles

customization

many user emacs customize editor suit needthree primary way customize emacs first customize
extension allows user set common customization variables
colour scheme using graphical interfaceintended emacs beginner want work emacs lisp
code

second collect keystroke macro replayautomate complex repetitive task often done adhoc
basis macro discarded use although macro saved
invoked need

third method customizing emacs using emacs lisp usually
usersupplied emacs lisp code stored file called emacsloaded emacs start emacs file often used set
variable key binding different default settingdefine new command user find convenient many advanced users
emacs file hundred line long idiosyncratic
customizations cause emacs diverge wildly default
behaviour

documentation

first emacs included powerful help library displaydocumentation every single command variable internal
function may originated techniqueemacs described selfdocumenting term doe mean
emacs writes documentation rather presents
documentation user feature make emacs
documentation accessible example user findcommand bound particular keystroke simply entering k
run command describekey followed keystrokefunction included documentation string specifically usedshowing user request practice giving functions
