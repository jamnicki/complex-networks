treatment

discrete probability theory

discrete probability theory deal event occur countable
sample spaces

example throwing dice experiment deck card random
walk

classical definition initially probability event occur

total outcome possible

example event occurrence even number die

function mapping point sample spaceprobability value called probability mass function abbreviated
pmf modern definition doe try answer probability

continuous probability theory

sample space real number function calledcumulative distribution function cdf assumed existgive pxle xfx 

cdf must satisfy following properties

probability distributions

certain random variable occur often probability theory duemany natural physical process distribution thereforegained special importance probability theory fundamental
discrete distribution discrete uniform bernoulli binomial
negative binomial poisson geometric distribution important
continuous distribution include continuous uniform normal
exponential gamma beta distributions

convergence random variables

probability theory several notion convergencerandom variable listed order strength subsequent notion convergence list implies convergence
according preceding notions
