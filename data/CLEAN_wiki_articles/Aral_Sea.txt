possible solutions

many different solution different problem suggested
year ranging feasibility cost include
improving quality irrigation canals
installing desalination plants
charging farmer use water rivers
using alternative cotton specie require water
melting glacier pamirs moving water refillarala short term solution long term negative effectfuture water supply provided glaciers
using fewer chemical cotton
