game pure strategy ne mixed extension
choosing pure strategy stochastically fixed
frequency nash proved allow mixed strategy players
choose strategy randomly according preassigned probabilities
every nplayer game every player choose finitely
many strategy admits least one nash equilibrium

nash equilibrium payoff matrix

easy numerical way identify nash equilibrium payoff
matrix especially helpful two person game playertwo strategy case formal analysis may becomelong rule doe apply case mixed stochastic
strategy interest rule follows first
payoff number duplet cell maximum column
cell second number maximum rowcellthen cell represents nash equilibrium

apply rule matrix

stability

concept stability useful analysis many kindequilibrium also applied nash equilibria

nash equilibrium mixed strategy game stable small
change specifically infinitesimal change probability one
player lead situation two condition hold
player change better strategy new
circumstance
player change playing strictly worse
strategy

case met player small changemixedstrategy return immediately nash equilibriumequilibrium said stable condition one doe holdequilibrium unstable condition one holdlikely infinite number optimal strategy player
changed john nash showed latter situation could arise
range welldefined games

driving game example stable unstable
equilibrium equilibrium involving mixedstrategies 
probability stable either player change probabilities
slightly disadvantage opponentreason change strategy turn 
equilibrium instability either player change probabilities
player immediately better strategy either 

stability crucial practical application nash equilibria
since mixedstrategy player perfectly knowninferred statistical distribution actiongame case unstable equilibrium unlikely arisepractice since minute change proportion strategy
seen lead change strategy breakdownequilibrium

note stability equilibrium related distinct

occurrence

condition met playerplayer utmost maximize expected
payoff described game
player flawless execution
