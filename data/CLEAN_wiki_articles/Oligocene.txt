oligocene paleogeography

period continent continued drift towardpresent position antarctica continued become isolatedfinally developed permanent ice caphaines

mountain building western north america continued alps
started rise europe african plate continued push north
eurasian plate brief marine incursion mark early
oligocene europe oligocene marine exposure rare north
america appears land bridge early
oligocene north america europe fauna two
region similar sometime oligocene south
america finally separated antarctica drifted north
towards north america also allowed circumpolar current flow
around antarctica rapidly cooling continent

oligocene flora

angiosperm continued expansion throughout world tropical
subtropical forest replaced temperate deciduous
woodland open plain desert became common grass expanded
waterbank habitat eocene moved open
tract however even end period quite common
enough modern savannahaines

north america subtropical specie dominated cashew lychee
tree present temperate tree rose beech pine
common legume pea bean family spread sedges
bulrush fern continued ascent

oligocene fauna

important oligocene land fauna found continent except
australia even open landscape allowed animal grow larger
size earlier paleogenehaines marine faunas
became fairly modern terrestrial vertebrate faunanorthern continent probably result older forms
dying result modern form evolving

south america apparently isolated continentevolved quite distinct fauna oligocene

mammals
