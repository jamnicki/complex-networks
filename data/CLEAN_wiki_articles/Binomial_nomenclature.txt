specie word binomial suggests scientific namespecie formed combination two term genus namespecie descriptor although fine detail differcertain aspect universally adopted
scientific name usually printed italic homo
sapiens handwritten underlined
first term genus namegeneric name always capitalized
specific descriptor zoology thespecific namebotany thespecific epithet never even derivedproper name

example canis lupus anthus hodgsoni notemodern convention carolus linnaeus always capitalizedspecific descriptor early centurycommon capitalize specific descriptor basedproper name although correct according modern
practice capitalized specific descriptor sometimes still
used nonscientific literature based older sources

scholarly text main entry binomial followedabbreviated botany full zoology surname scientist
first published classification specie assigned
different genus description todayabbreviation name describer description dateset parentheses

example amaranthus retroflexus passer domesticus
linnaeusthe latter originally described member
genus fringilla hence parentheses

used common name scientific name usually follows

example canis lupus becomes lupus rare caseabbreviation form spread general usefor examplebacterium escherichia coli often referred coli
tyrannosaurus rex perhaps even better known simplyrex

nomenclature various form existed linnaeus usedbauhins lived nearly two hundred year linnaeuslinnaeus hardly anybody used binomial nomenclature linnaeus
almost everybody
value binomial nomenclature

value binomial nomenclature system derives primarilyeconomy widespread use stability namegenerally favors
every specie unambiguously identified two words
name used world languages
avoiding difficulty translation
although stability exists far absoluteprocedure associated establishing binomial nomenclature tend
favour stability example specie transferred
genus uncommonly happens result new
knowledge possible specie descriptor keptsimilarly previously thought distinct species
demoted specie lower rank former specie name may
retained infraspecific descriptors

despite rule favoring stability uniqueness practicesingle specie may several scientific name circulation
depending largely taxonomic point view see synonymy

major source instability resurrection forgotten names
claim priority publication case however
conservation according nomenclature code possible

code nomenclature

mid nineteenth century onwards became ever apparent
body rule necessary govern scientific namecourse time became nomenclature code governing naminganimalsiczn plant incl fungi cyanobacteriaicbn bacteria
icnb virus code differ
example icbn plant code doe allow tautonyms
whereas iczn animal code doe allow tautonymy
starting point time code effect
retroactively vary group group botany starting
