definitions

group set binary operationthat satisfiesfollowing four axioms
closurefor g result also associativity c abcabc
identity element exists element gg eaaea
inverse element exists element g
abbae identity element

text omit explicit requirement closure since closure
group follows fact operationis binary
operation

using identity element property shown groupexactly one identity element see simple theorems

inverse element also shown unique left
rightinverses element definitionthus slightly narrow substituting second third axioms
concept left right identity element left
right inverse element

also note group often denoted simply gambiguity operation
basic concept group theory

order group elements

abelian groups

cyclic groups

cyclic group group whose element may generated successive
composition operation defining group appliedsingle element group single element calledgenerator primitive element group

subgroup generated element group howevergroup constructed cyclic subgroup necessarilycyclic group example klein group cyclic group even
though constructed two copy cyclic group order


notation groups

group use different notation depending contextgroup operation
additive group useto denote addition minus signto
denote inverse example aain multiplicative group usecdotor general
composition symbol circ denote multiplicationsuperscriptto denote inverse example aait
common drop theand write instead
function group useto denote function compositionsuperscriptto denote inverse example ggecommon drop theand write instead

omitting symbol operation generally acceptable leaves
reader know context group operation

defining group standard notation use parenthesisdefining group operation example hdenotesset group addition group like znand

proving set group

two main method proving set group
prove set subgroup group
prove set group using definition

first method generally referred thesubgroup testrequires prove following trying prove hsubgroup
set nonempty subset ie identity element
inside
h closed operation ab hh h

second method requires prove axiomassumption definition set g nonempty
g closed binary operation
g associative
e usually follows nonemptiness
g consists units

finite group one need prove subset nonempty
closed ambient group operation
