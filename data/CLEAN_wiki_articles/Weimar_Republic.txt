even moderate disliked extremist left right
loathed germany democratic tradition weimar democracy
wa widely seen chaotic since weimar politicianblamed thestab back led surrendergerman army world war government legitimacy shaky
ground

single reason explain failure weimar republiccommonly asserted cause grouped three categories
economic problem institutional problem role specific
individuals

economic problems

weimar republic serious economic problem ever
experienced western democracy history rampant
hyperinflation massive unemployment large drop living
standard primary factor inthere short periodeconomic recovery great depression ledworldwide recession germany particularly affecteddepended heavily american loan inaboutmillion germans
unemployed many blamed weimar republic made

weimar republic severely affected great depression

economic stagnation led increased demand germany repaydebt owed weimar republic fragileexistence depression proved devastating playedmajor role nsdaps takeover

even supported hitler appointment often want nazism
entirety considered hitler temporary solutioneffort abolish republic industry support alone cannot explain

including many worker turned away left

institutional problems

widely agreed theconstitution several weaknesses
making eventual establishment dictatorship likelyunknown whether different constitution could prevented third
reich however thewest german constitution grundgesetzgenerally viewed strong response flaws
institution reichsprsident frequently consideredersatzkaiser substitute emperor attempt replacekaiser resigned fled inwith similarly strong
institution meant diminish party politics articleofconstitution gave president power take necessary steps
public order security seriously disturbedendangered although intended emergency clausewa often used beforeto issue decree without supportparliament see also made gleichschaltung easierexample reichstag fire decree issued basisarticle
