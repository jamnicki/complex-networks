special theory relativity proposed inby albert

three century earlier galileo principle relativitystated uniform motion relative waabsolute welldefined state rest person deck ship

account gravity deal accelerations

although special relativity make relative quantitytime would imagined absolute based everyday
experience also make absolute others wouldthought relative particular state speed light
observer even motion relativeone another special relativity reveals velocity
certain phenomenonlightbut rather fundamental featureway space time tied together particular special
relativity state impossible material objecttravel fast light

consequences

einstein said consequence special relativity
found examination lorentz transformations

transformation hence special relativity lead different
physical prediction newtonian mechanic relative velocities
become comparable speed light speed light much
larger anything human encounter effects
predicted relativity initially counterintuitive
time dilationthe time lapse two event invariant
one observer another dependent relative
speed observer reference frame twin paradox
concern twin fly spaceship travelling near
speed light return discover twin aged
muchrelativity simultaneitytwo event happening two different
location occur simultaneously one observer may occurdifferent time another observer lack absolute
simultaneity
lorentz contractionthe dimension length objectmeasured one observer may smaller resultmeasurement object made another observer egladder paradox involves long ladder travelling near speedlight contained within smaller garage
composition velocitiesvelocities speed simply
add example rocket moving atthe speed light
relative observer rocket fire missile atofspeed light relative rocket missile doe exceed
speed light relative observer exampleobserver would see missile travel speed ofthe
speed light
inertia momentumas object velocity get closerspeed light becomes difficult accelerate
equivalence mass energy emcmass energyconverted one another play equivalent role eggravitational force falling apple partly due kinetic
energy subatomic particle made
simultaneity
