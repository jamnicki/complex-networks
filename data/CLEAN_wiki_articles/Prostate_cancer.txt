prostate

prostate male reproductive organ help make store
seminal fluid adult men typical prostate three
centimeter long weighs twenty gram locatedpelvis urinary bladder front rectumprostate surround part urethra tube carry urine
bladder urination semen ejaculationlocation prostate disease often affect urination ejaculation

gland require male hormone known androgen work properly
androgen include testosterone made testes
dehydroepiandrosterone made adrenal glanddihydrotestosterone made prostate androgen also
responsible secondary sex characteristic facial hairincreased muscle mass

symptoms

early prostate cancer usually cause symptom often diagnosed
workup elevated psa noticed routine checkup
sometimes however prostate cancer doe cause symptom often similar
disease benign prostatic hypertrophyinclude frequent urination increased urination night difficulty
starting maintaining steady stream urine blood urine
painful urination prostate cancer may also cause problemsexual function difficulty achieving erection painful
ejaculation

advanced prostate cancer may cause additional symptom disease

screening

prostate cancer screening attempt find unsuspected cancers
screening test may lead specific followup testbiopsy small piece prostate removed closer
study ofprostate cancer screening option include digital
rectal exam prostate specific antigen psa blood test
screening prostate cancer controversial clear
benefit screening outweigh risk followup diagnostic
test cancer treatments

small cancer would never become life threateningpsa test men may lead overdiagnosis including additional
testing treatment followup test prostate biopsy may
cause pain bleeding infection prostate cancer treatment may
cause urinary incontinence erectile dysfunction thereforeessential risk benefit diagnostic proceduretreatment carefully considered psa screening

hormonal therapy chemotherapy often reserved diseaseha spread beyond prostate however exceptions
radiation therapy may used advanced tumor hormonal

watchful waiting

watchful waiting also called active surveillance refersobservation regular monitoring without invasive treatment watchful
waiting often used early stage slowgrowing prostate cancer
found older man watchful waiting may also suggestedrisk surgery radiation therapy hormonal therapy outweigh
possible benefit treatment started symptoms

surgery

surgical removal prostate prostatectomy common

survivor common serious complication loss urinary
control impotence many forty percent men left
urinary incontinence usually form leakagesneeze cough laugh impotence also common problem
although penile sensation ability achieve orgasm usually
remain intact erection ejaculation often impaired medications

however radiation therapy cause tissue change prostatectomy
radiation higher risk complications

transurethral resection prostate commonly called turpsurgical procedure performed tube bladderpenisurethra blocked prostate enlargement turp generally
