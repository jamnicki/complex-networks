melting solid rock

melting solid rock form magma controlled three physical
parameter temperature pressure composition mechanismdiscussed entry igneous rock

temperature

given pressure given composition rock risetemperature past solidus cause melting within solid
earth temperature rock controlled geothermal
gradient radioactive decay within rock geothermal

partial melting

globule melt generally occurring mineral grain link
