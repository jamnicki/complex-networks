cultural aspects

many people find direct sunlight bright comfort
especially reading white paper upon sun directly
shining indeed looking directly sun cause permanent vision
damage compensate brightness sunlight many people wear
sunglass car many helmet cap equipped visorblock sun direct vision sun low angle

colder country many people prefer sunnier day often avoidshade hotter country converse true midday
hour many people prefer stay inside remain cool outside seek shade may provided tree parasol
sunshine often blocked entering building usewindow blind awning shutter curtains
