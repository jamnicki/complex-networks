measurement estimation determination extent dimensioncapacity usually relation standard unit measurement
measurement expressed number unit standardreal number time unit distance indicated number
mile kilometers

process measuring involves estimating ratio magnitude
quantity magnitude unit type length
time mass etc measurement result process
expressed product real number unit real
number estimated ratio example ismetresestimate object length relative unit length metre
unlike count integer quantity item known exactly
every measurement estimate uncertainty

overview

natural science act measuring object normally
involves comparing magnitude quantity possessed object
standard unit using instrument controlled
condition example measuring instrument include thermometer
speedometer weighing scale voltmeter order measure
accurately measuring instrument must carefully constructedcalibrated however measurement degree uncertainty
associated usually expressed standard errormeasurement mean measurement usually givennumber followed unit every measurement three componentestimate error bound probability actual magnitude
lie within error bound estimate example measurement
plank might result measurement ofmeters plus minus 
meter probability 

measurement usually distinguished count measurementreal number never exact count natural number mayexact example determine exactlyeggscarton counting however group easily
counted estimating number involve similar issuephysical measurement example figure number people
hiv number star milky way associated
standard error viewed estimate rather exact
counts

imperial system

si unit widely adopted around world british
system english unit later imperial unit used britain
commonwealth united state system came knownu customary unit united state still usecaribbean country various system measurementtime called footpoundsecond system imperial units
distance weight time interesting note many
imperial unit remain use britain despite factmostly switched system road sign still mile yards
mile per hour etc people tend measure height feet
inch beer sold pint give examples
imperial unit used many place example many
commonwealth country considered metricated land areameasured acre floor space square foot particularlycommercial transaction rather government statistic similarly
imperial gallon used many country considered
metricated gaspetrol station example united arab
emirates

metric system

metric system decimalised system measurement basedmeter gram exists several variation different
choice base unit though affect daytoday use
