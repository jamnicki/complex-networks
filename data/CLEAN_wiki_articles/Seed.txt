seed structure

seed contains embryo new plant growproper condition seed also usually contain supply stored food
wrapped seed coat testa seed diversesize dustlike orchid seed smallest one
million seed per gram orchid seed immature embryosignificant food reserve mycoheterotrophs dependingmycorrhizal fungi nutrition germination overkglargest seed coco mer

embryo one cotyledon seed leaf monocotyledon two
cotyledon almost dicotyledon two gymnosperms
radicle embryonic root plumule embryonic shoot
embryonic stem point attachment cotyledonepicotyl embryonic stem point attachmenthypocotyl

angiosperm stored food begin tissue calledendosperm derived parent plant via double
fertilization usually triploid endosperm rich oil starch
protein gymnosperm conifer food storage tissue
part female gametophyte haploid tissue

specie embryo embedded endosperm female
gametophyte seedling use upon germination others
endosperm absorbed embryo latter grows withindeveloping seed cotyledon embryo become filledstored food maturity seed specie endosperm
termed exalbuminous seed exalbuminous seed bean
pea oak walnut squash sunflower radish seedendosperm maturity termed albuminous seed monocot grass palm many dicot brazil nut castor bean
albuminous seed gymnosperm seed albuminous

seed coat develops tissue integument originally
surrounding ovule seed coat mature seedpaperthin layer peanut something substantial thick hard honey locust coconut seed coat helps
protect embryo mechanical injury drying
seed angiosperm contained hard fleshylayer structure called fruit gymnosperm seed begindevelopment naked bract cone although seedbecome covered cone scale develop example hard

order seed coat split embryo must imbibe soakwater cause swell splitting seed coat howevernature seed coat determines rapidly water penetratesubsequently initiate germination seed thick coat
scarification seed coat may necessary water reach
embryo example scarification include gnawing animals
freezing thawing battering rock stream bed passing
animal digestive tract latter case seed coat
protects seed digestion perhaps weakening seed coat
embryo ready sprout get deposited along
bit fertilizer far parent plant speciethin seed coat light may able penetrate dormant
embryo presence light absence light may triggergermination process inhibiting germination seed burieddeeply others buried soil abscisic acid usually
growth inhibitor seeds

seed functions

dandelion seedsachenes carried long distance wind

unlike animal plant limited ability seekfavorable condition life growth consequence plantevolved many way disperse population seed see
also vegetative reproduction seed must somehow arrivelocation time favorable germination growth
seed dispersal often attributed mainly fruit however many seeds
aid dispersal example
many seed maple pine wing aid wind
dispersal
dustlike seed orchid carried efficiently wind
seed dandelion milkweed poplar hair aid

attach animal fur feather drop later
seed mangrove viviparous begin germinate
still attached parent large heavy root allows
seed penetrate ground falls
seed appendage called elaiosomes bloodroot
trillium acacia elaiosomes provide food antusually disperse seeds
plant mucuna dioclea produce buoyant seeds
termed seabeans drift seed float riverocean wash beach 

annual seed way specie survive dry cold
season ephemeral plant usually annual seedseed six weeks

one important function seed delaying germination allow
time dispersal prevent seed germinatingcondition favorable staggering germination preventsseed germinating wiped bad weatherherbivore seed dormancy defined seed failing germinate
environmental condition optimal germination often
confused seed quiescence seed failing germinate
environmental condition inappropriate germination
many cultivated seed lack dormancy germinate seed
packet simply insufficient moisture
