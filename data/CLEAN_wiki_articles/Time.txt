einstein said reason time everything
doesnt happen regard einstein said timebasically clock read clock action change
like movement sun einstein showed people travelingdifferent speed measure different time event different
distance object though difference minute unless
one traveling speed close light many subatomic
particle exist fixed fraction second lab
relatively rest travel close speed light
