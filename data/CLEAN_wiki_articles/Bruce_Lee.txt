philosophy

although bruce lee best known martial artist actor lee
majored philosophy university washington lee bookmartial art fighting philosophy wellknownphilosophical assertion inside outside martial arts
circle philosophy often mirrored fighting belief thoughwa quick claim martial art solely metaphorteaching influence include taoism buddhismwriting krishnamurti

following bruce lee quote reflect fighting
philosophy
formless shapeless like water put water cup
becomes cup put water bottle becomesbottle put teapot becomes teapot waterflow crash water friend
relaxed muscle energy flowbody using muscular tension try punchattempting use brute force knock someone work
opposite effect
mere technical knowledge beginning kung fumaster one must enter spiritlot guy around world lazyfat gut talk chi power thingdont believeim master studentmaster meaningknowledge master expertise master still
learning studentmaster dont believe word
master consider master closecasket
deny classical approach simply reactioncreated another pattern trappedjeet kune name dont fussthing style understand root combat
unfortunately boxing people allowed punchjudo people allowed throw despisekind martial art mean find rigid forms
create difference among clan world martial art
shattered result
think high state martial art application mustabsolute form tackle pattern pattern mayabsolutely correct
true observation begin one devoid set patterns
weakness clan formed people clan
hold kind martial art truthdare reform improve thus confinedtiny little world student become machine imitate
martial art forms
people tall short stoutslim various different kind peoplelearn martial art form doe fit
ultimately martial art mean honestly expressingeasy put show cocky showreally fancy movement express oneself honestly lying
oneself express honestly enough friend
harduse way way use limitation limitation
powerful fighter ordinary man laser precision
focus
one great cause failure lack concentration
spend much time thinking thing youll never
get done
