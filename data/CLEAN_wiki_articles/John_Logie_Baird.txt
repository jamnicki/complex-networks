inventions

bairds early invention standardtwenty tried create diamond heating graphite shorted
glasgow electricity supply long afterwards baird perfectedglass razor completely rust resistant shattered
inspired pneumatic tyre pneumatic shoeprototype contained semiinflated balloon burst also
invented thermal undersock actually mild success

bairds numerous development demonstrate particular talent
invention developed ina primitive video recording
device dubbed phonovision system consistedphonodisc rpm record could play line video
signal development fibreoptics radio direction
finding infrared night viewing radar still remain however
question exact contribution development radar
wartime defence project never officially
acknowledged british government according malcolm bairdson known inbaird filed patent device
formed image reflected radio wave device remarkably
similar radar correspondence british
government time much information regarding bairds work
area beginning emerge
