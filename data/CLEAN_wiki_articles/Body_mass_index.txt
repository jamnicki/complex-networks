calculation

bmi defined individual body weight divided squareheight almost always expressed unit kgmtherefore often left bmi value calculatedfollowing formulae

calculating bmi using unit preferred

usage

bmi become controversial many people including
physician come rely medical diagnosisbutha never bmi purpose meant used simple
mean classifying sedentary physically inactive individualaverage body composition individual current value
setting follows bmi oftomay indicate optimal
weight bmi lower thansuggests person underweightnumber abovemay indicate person overweight bmi 
may indicate person eating disorder number 
suggests person obese overmorbidly obese

physiology termweight used interchangeably 
mass given body shape given density bmiproportional height body dimension increase bythe
bmi increase 

generally bmi chart display calculated bmi function weight
horizontal axis height vertical axis using contour linedifferent value bmi color different bmi categories

accuracy

bmi meant broadly categorise population purely
statistical purpose noted accuracy relation actual
level body fat easily distorted factor fitness
level muscle mass bone structure gender ethnicity peoplemesomorphic tend higher bmi number peopleendomorphic greater bone mass greater muscle
mass respectively endomorphic individuals

similarly ectomorphic individual could conceivably receiveunhealthily low reading fact body type makenaturally thin matter eat

people short stature tend lower bmi thereforeuse lower cutoff value obesity diagnosis appliesolder people whose reduced muscle mass hide additional body fat
without increasing bmi

bmi categories

applications

statistical device

body mass index generally used mean correlationgroup related general mass serve basic meanestimating adiposity however duality body mass indexwhilst easytouse general calculation limitedaccurate pertinent data obtained generallyindex suitable recognising trend within sedentary overweight
individual smaller margin errors

general correlation particularly useful consensus data
regarding obesity various condition usedbuild semiaccurate representation solutionstipulated rda group calculated similarlybecoming pertinent growth child duemajority exercise habits

growth child usually documented bmimeasured
growth chart obesity trend calculated difference
child bmi bmi chart however method
fall prey obstacle body composition many childgenerally born grow endomorph would classed obese
despite body composition clinical professional takeaccount child body composition defer appropriate
technique densiometry

clinical practice

bmi calculated quickly without expensive equipment however
bmi category take account factor frame sizemuscularity category also fail account varying
proportion muscle fat bonecartilage water weight

despite bmi category generally regarded satisfactory
tool measuring whether sedentary individual underweight
overweight obese used standard
recording obesity statistic since early united
state bmi also used measure underweight owing advocacy
behalf suffering eating disorder anorexia
nervosa bulimia nervosa

individual sedentaryespecially athletesas wellchild elderly infirm individual naturally
endomorphic ectomorphic people dont medium frame
illfitted assessment using bmi state problem
accurately bmi measurement people mayunderweight overweight obese different sedentary
mesomorph whose age aboutand 

athlete problem muscle denser fatprofessional athlete overweight obese accordingbmiunless number considered overweightobese adjusted upward child elderly differencebone density thus proportion bone total weightmean number people considered underweightadjusted downward

case method actually measuring body fat percentagealways preferable bmi measuring healthy body size

problems

general rule developed muscle denser fat bmiaccount therefore person muscle massbodybuilder seem overweight likewise couldstipulated longdistance endurance athlete wouldclassified ectomorphic underweight anorexic starvationtype athlete tends low body fat well developed slow
twitch muscle doe contribute greatly muscle massindividual could widely regarded perfect compositeparticular sport due limitation body compositionathlete would calculated using body mass index instead
body fat would determined technique skinfold
measurement underwater weighing parallel sportsmanwoman sport rugby size muscle oftenimportance could listed overweight due large amountmuscle extreme many bodybuilder would classifiedmorbidly obese markus rhl bmi 

another issue competitive athlete often know accurately
actual height weight general publictendency toward overestimating height underestimating
weight bmi standard public health tool taketendency account lead athlete higher
reported bmi lay person height weight

mayo clinic researcher say bmi doesnt accurately predict riskcardiovascular death doesnt distinguish musclefat say better measure may waisthip ratio

analysis led lopezjiminez ofstudies involving 
people heart patient normal bmi higher risk death
cardiovascular disease people whose bmi putobese range
