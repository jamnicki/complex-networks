safety

principal danger formic acid skin eye contactliquid formic acid concentrated vaporexposure route cause severe chemical burn eye exposureresult permanent eye damage inhaled vapor may similarly cause
irritation burn respiratory tract since carbon monoxide may
also present formic acid vapor care taken wherever

formic acid readily metabolized eliminated body
nonetheless chronic effect documented animal
