pollinator decline based observation made endtwentieth century reduction abundance pollinator many
ecosystem worldwide

pollinator participate sexual reproduction many plantensuring cross pollination essential specie major
factor ensuring genetic diversity others since plantprimary food source animal reduction one primary
pollination agent even possible disappearance raised
concern conservation pollinator become partbiodiversity conservation efforts

observation pollinator decline

planting grown larger need concentrated pollinators
bloom time grown time population many
pollinator declining decline become major
environmental issue today pollination management seek protect
enhance augment agricultural pollination

example feral honeybee population droppedpastyears except southwestreplaced africanized bee time managed honeybee
colony dropped two thirds

monoculture need high population bloom make area
quite barren even toxic bloom done

study pollinator decline also interesting scientistbee potential become keystone indicator environmental
degradation change abundance diversityinfluence abundance diversity prevailing plant species
mutual dependency bee rely steady nectar sourcepollen source throughout year build hive

consequences

value bee pollination human nutrition food wildlife
immense difficult quantify

commonly said one third human nutrition duebee pollination includes majority fruit many vegetables
seed crop secondary effect legume alfalfa
clover fed livestock

increasing public awareness

catastrophic result food supply

possible explanation pollinator decline

pesticide misuse

label violation apply insecticide cropbloom allow pesticide drift blooming weed bees
visiting yet application frequently done little
enforcement bee protection direction pesticide misusedriven beekeeper business affect native wild bee even
worse human move protect
bumblebee population bad shape cottongrowing areas
bumbles hit pesticide applicator apply
insecticide blooming cotton field bee foraging

widespread aerial application mosquito medfly grasshoppers
gypsy moth insect leaf island safety wild
insect pollinator reproduce repopulate one programknock pollinator population several years

route discontinue migration good example endangered

solution pollinator decline

decline pollinator compensated extent beekeepers
becoming migratory following bloom northward springsouthern wintering location migration may traditional honey
crop increasingly contract pollination supply needs
grower crop require
conservation restoration efforts

effort made sustain pollinator diversity agronatural ecosystem environmental group prairie restoration
establishment wildlife preserve encouragement diverse
wildlife landscaping rather monoculture lawn exampleway help pollinators

use alternative pollinators
