chemically fatty acid described longchain monocarboxylic
acid general structure chchncooh length
chain usually range fromtoalways even number
carbon carbon chain contains double bondcalled saturated contains one bondunsaturated presence double bond generally reduces melting

lipid play diverse important role nutrition health many
lipid absolutely essential life however also
considerable awareness abnormal level certain lipids
particularly cholesterol hypercholesterolemia recently
trans fatty acid risk factor heart diseasediseases
