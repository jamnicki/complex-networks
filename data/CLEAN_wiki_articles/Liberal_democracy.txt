advantage disadvantage liberal democracy

direct democracy

argue liberal democracy doe respect absolute majority
rule except electing representative liberty majority
rule restricted constitution precedent decided previous
generation also real power actually held relatively
small representative body thus argument liberal democracy
merely decoration oligarchy system direct democracy
would preferable new technology edemocracy may make
direct democracy easier implement

others would say liberal democracy guaranteeindividual liberty citizen prevent developmentdictatorship unmoderated majority rule could view leadoppression minority another argument elected leaders
may interested able average voter thirdtake much effort time everyone gather information

ethnic religious conflicts

historical reason many state culturally ethnically

bureaucracy

persistent libertarian monarchist critique democracyclaim encourages elected representative change law
without necessity particular pour forth flood new laws
seen pernicious several way new law constrictscope previously private liberty rapidly changing laws
make difficult willing nonspecialist remain lawabiding
may invitation lawenforcement agency misuse power
claimed continual complication law may contraryclaimed simple eternal natural lawalthough consensus
natural law even among advocate supporterdemocracy point complex bureaucracy regulationoccurred dictatorship like many former communist states

liberal democracy also criticised claimed slownesscomplexity decisionmaking

shortterm focus

modern liberal democracy definition allow regular changegovernment led common criticism shortterm
focus four five year government face new election
must think win election would
encourage preference policy bring short term benefits
electorate selfinterested politician next
election rather unpopular policy longer term benefitcriticism assumes possible make long term predictionsociety something karl popper criticized historicism

besides regular review governing entity shortterm focusdemocracy could also result collective shortterm thinking
example consider campaign policy aimed reducing
environmental damage causing temporary increase unemployment
however risk applies also political systems

public choice theory

public choice theory branch economics studydecisionmaking behaviour voter politician government
official perspective economic theory one studied problem
voter little influence may thereforerational ignorance regarding political issue may allow special
interest group gain subsidy regulation beneficialharmful society however special interest group may equally
influential nondemocracies

plutocracy

marxist socialist anarchist argue liberal democracyintegral part capitalist system classbased fully
democratic participatory bourgeois democracyfinancially powerful people rule seenfundamentally unegalitarian existing operating wayfacilitates economic exploitation

cost political campaigning representative democracy may
mean system favour rich form plutocracy maysmall minority voter athenian democracy public

majoritarianism

tyranny majority fear democratic government
reflecting majority view take action oppressesparticular minority theoretically majority couldmajority vote majority citizencase one minority tyrannizes another minority namemajority apply direct democracy representative
democracy

possible example include
potentially subject conscription minority
several european country introduced ban personal
religious symbol public school opponent seeviolation right freedom religion supporter seefollowing separation state religious activities
prohibition pornography typically determinedmajority prepared accept
recreational drug use also typically legalised least
tolerated degree majority find acceptable users
may see oppressed minority victimunjustifiable criminalisation
society treatment homosexual also cited context
homosexual act widely criminalised democracyseveral decade ago democracy still reflecting
religious sexual majority
athenian democracy early united state slavery
majority often tax minority wealthyprogressively higher rate intention wealthy
incur larger tax burden social purpose howevergenerally offset degree better accessrelevant expert advice tax consultant lawyers
prosperous western democracy poor form minoritypopulation may disadvantaged majority resent
transfer taxation especially form distinct underclass
majority may use democratic process effect withdraw
protection state
often quoted example tyranny majorityadolf hitler came power legitimate democratic procedurenazi party gained largest share vote democratic
weimar republic insome might consider exampletyranny minority since never gained majority votecommon plurality exercise power democracyrise hitler considered irrelevant howeverregime largescale human right violation took placedemocratic system abolished also weimar constitution
emergency allowed dictatorial power suspensionessential constitution without vote election
something possible liberal democracies

proponent democracy make number defence concerning tyranny
majority one argue presence constitution
protecting right citizen many democratic country acts
safeguard generally change constitution requireagreement supermajority elected representative require
judge jury agree evidentiary procedural standards
fulfilled state two different voterepresentative separated election sometimes referendum
requirement often combined separation powerlegislative branch executive branch judicial branch also makedifficult small majority impose meanmajority still legitimately coerce minority still
ethically questionable minority would smallpractical matter harder get larger proportionpeople agree actions

another argument majority minority take markedly
different shape different issue people often agreemajority view issue agree minority viewissue one view may also change thus member majority may
limit oppression minority since may well future
minority

third common argument despite risk majority rulepreferable system tyranny majoritycase improvement tyranny minority possible
problem mentioned also occur nondemocraciesadded problem minority oppress majority proponentdemocracy argue empirical statistical evidence strongly showdemocracy lead internal violence mass murdergovernment sometimes formulated rummels law states
le democratic freedom people likelyruler murder
political stability

one argument democracy creating systempublic remove administration without changing legal basisgovernment democracy aim reducing political uncertaintyinstability assuring citizen however much may disagree
present policy given regular chance change
power change policy disagree
preferable system political change take place
violence

think political stability may considered excessivegroup power remains extended period timehand common nondemocracies

one notable feature liberal democracy opponents
group wish abolish liberal democracy rarely win
election advocate use argument support viewliberal democracy inherently stable usuallyoverthrown external force opponent argue systeminherently stacked despite claim impartialitypast feared democracy could easily exploitedleader dictatorial aspiration could get elected
power however actual number liberal democracyelected dictator power low occurredusually major crisis caused many people doubtsystem youngpoorly functioning democracy possible
example include adolf hitler great depression napoleon
iii become first president young second french republiclater emperor

effective response wartime

liberal democracy definition implies powerconcentrated one criticism could disadvantagestate wartime fast unified response necessarylegislature usually must give consent start offensive
military operation although sometimes executivekeeping legislature informed democracyattacked consent usually required defensive operations
people may vote conscription army monarchydictatorship theory act immediately forcefully

however actual research show democracy likely win
war nondemocracies one explanation attribute primarilytransparency polity stabilitypreference determined democracy better able cooperate

better information correction problems

democratic system may provide better information policy
decision undesirable information may easily ignoreddictatorship even undesirable contrarian information
provides early warning problem democratic system also provides
way replace inefficient leader policy thus problem may
continue longer crisis kind may commonautocracies
