meteorological instrument measure wind speed andor direction

wind direction reported direction originates
example northerly wind blow north south

local sensing techniques
anemometer measure wind speed either directly egrotating cup indirectly via pressure differencepropagation speed ultrasound signals
rawinsondegpsbased wind measurement performed probe
weather balloon passive measurement balloon position tracked
ground visually via radar wind profile computed
drift rate theoretical speed ascent
