biography

sir humphry revelled status lecture gathered many
spectator davy became well known due experimentphysiological action gas including laughing gasnitrous

inalessandro volta announced invention first electric
pile battery davy used electric battery separate saltknown electrolysis many battery seriesable separate elemental potassium sodium inand calcium
strontium barium magnesium inwhich also
discovered named aluminium also studied energy involved
separating salt field electrochemistry
according historian christopher lawrence book

lamp used miner although evidence showdavy invented device time engineer
george stephenson claimed credit invention

discovery chlorine

also showed oxygen could obtained substance
known oxymuriatic acid proved substance element
named chlorine however carl scheele crediteddiscoverer chlorine scheele discovered ityears davy
wa unable publish finding discovery overturned
lavoisier definition acid compound oxygen

acid base studies

indavy suggested acid substance contained
replaceable hydrogenhydrogen could partly totally
replaced metal acid reacted metal formed salts
base substance reacted acid form salt water
definition worked well century today usebrnstedlowry theory acid bases

inhe awarded baronetcy two year later became
president royal society
