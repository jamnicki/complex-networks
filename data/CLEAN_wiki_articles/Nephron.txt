nephron basic structural functional unit kidney
chief function regulate water soluble substancefiltering blood reabsorbing needed excreting rest
urine nephron eliminate waste body regulate blood
volume pressure control level electrolyte metabolites
regulate blood function vital liferegulated endocrine system hormone antidiuretic
hormone aldosterone parathyroid hormone

juxtaglomerular apparatus

juxtaglomerular apparatus occurs near site contactthick ascending limb afferent arteriole contains three
components
macula densa tightlypacked area cell thick ascending
limb
juxtaglomerular cell specialized smooth muscle cell wallafferent arteriole
extraglomerular mesangial cell couple arterioles

juxtaglomerular cell site renin synthesis secretionthus play critical role reninangiotensin system
