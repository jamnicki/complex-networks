farming methods

shrimp farming emerged economically viable
alternative satisfy growing market demand surpassedcapacity wild shrimp fishery subsistence farming methodold rapidly replaced intensive practiceexportoriented business industrial shrimp farming first followed
traditional method socalled extensive shrimp farmcompensated low yield per area increased pond sizes
instead pond hectare pond size toha
one used place initially largely unregulated
business boomed many region whole coastline transformed
huge area mangrove cleared technological advances
made intensive farming practice possible could achieve
higher yield per area using land semiintensiveintensive farm appeared shrimp reared artificial
feed pond actively managed although still many
extensive farm new farm typically semiintensive kind

mids shrimp farm stocked young wild
shrimp called postlarvae typically caught local fishermen
postlarvae fishing became important economic sector many
country counteract beginning depletion fishing groundensure steady supply young shrimp farm industry
started raising shrimp egg maintaining adult shrimpreproductive purpose specialized installation called hatcheries
