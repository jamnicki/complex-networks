diet coconut crab consists primarily fruit including
coconut fig however eat nearly anything organic
including leaf rotten fruit tortoise egg dead animalshell animal believed provide calciummay also eat live animal slow escape freshly

safe eating

coconut crab climb tree eat coconut fruit escapeheat escape predator common perception coconut
crab cut coconut tree eat ground hence
german name palm thief dutch klapperdief however
according late german biologist holger rumpf sometimes spelled
rumpff animal intelligent enough planned action

cultural aspects

hermit crab intimidating size strength special
position culture islander coconut crab eatenpacific islander considered delicacy aphrodisiac
taste similar lobster crabmeat prized partegg inside female coconut crab fat abdomen
coconut crab cooked similar way lobster boilingsteaming different island also variety recipeexample coconut crab cooked coconut milk

coconut crab poisonous may become poisonous
depending diet case coconut crab poisoningoccurred believed poison come plant toxinwould explain animal poisonous others may
also possible poison considered aphrodisiac similar
highly poisonous pufferfish eaten japan however coconut
crab commercial product usually sold

hunting best moonless night wet ground using flashlights
best time three day following new moon coconut crabs
also hunted day involves digging reach
burrow fire smoke hiding
place also suggested spreading burnt coconut halfattract coconut crabs

child sometimes play coconut crab placing wet grassangle palm tree contains coconut crab animal
climb belief grass ground release grip
tree subsequently falls

coconut crab admired strength saidvillager use animal guard coconut plantation coconut
crab may attack person threatened coconut crab
especially yet fully grown also sold petexample tokyo cage must strong enough animal cannot
