background

following british evacuation dunkirk french surrender

abyss new dark age made sinister perhaps
protracted light perverted science let therefore brace duty bearbritish empire commonwealth last thousand
year men still saythis finest hour

british rejection german term therefore emphatic
recognising thisand effort finish war west 
hitler subsequently ordered rapid preparation invasion plan
britain onjuly hitler hoped perhaps frighten britain
