formation

tropical cyclone typically form large disorganized areadisturbed weather tropical region thunderstorm formgather storm develops rainbands start rotating aroundcommon centre storm gain strength ring stronger
convection form certain distance rotational centredeveloping storm since stronger thunderstorm heavier rain

area high atmospheric pressure central dense
overcast consequentially built air flow outward
