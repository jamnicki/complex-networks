history

etymology

word statistic ultimately derives modern latin term
statisticum collegium council state italian word
statistastatesman orpolitician german statistik first
introduced gottfried achenwalloriginally designatedanalysis data state signifying science state
called political arithmetic english acquired meaning
collection classification data generally early
th century introduced english sir john sinclair

thus original principal purpose statistik data used
governmental often centralized administrative bodycollection data state locality continues largely
national international statistical service particular
census provide regular information population

th century creation precise instrument public
health concernsepidemiology biostatistics etc economicsocial purposesunemployment rate econometry etc necessitated
substantial advance statistical practice became necessity
western welfare state developed world wardevelop specific knowledge population philosophermichel foucault argued constituted form 
biopower term since used many authors

conceptual overview

applying statistic scientific industrial societal
problem one begin process population studiedmight population people country crystal grainrock good manufactured particular factory given
period may instead process observed various time data
collected kind population constitute calledtime series

practical reason rather compiling data entire
population one usually instead study chosen subsetpopulation called sample data collected sampleobservational experimental setting data subjectedstatistical analysis serf two related purpose description
inference
descriptive statistic used summarize data either
numerically graphically describe sample basic examples
numerical descriptor include mean standard deviation
graphical summarization include various kind chartgraphs
inferential statistic used model pattern data
accounting randomness drawing inference larger
population inference may take form answer yesno
questionshypothesis testing estimate numerical
characteristicsestimation forecasting future observations
description associationcorrelation modelingrelationshipsregression modeling technique include
anova time series data mining

concept correlation particularly noteworthy statistical
analysis data set may reveal two variable two
property population consideration tend vary
together connected example study annual
income age death among people might find poor people tend
shorter life affluent people two variable said
correlated however one cannot immediately infer existence
causal relationship two variable see correlation
doe imply causation

sample representative population inferenceconclusion made sample extended populationwhole major problem lie determining extentchosen sample representative statistic offer method estimate
correct randomness sample data collection
procedure well method designing robust experimentfirst place see experimental design

fundamental mathematical concept employed understandingrandomness probability mathematical statistic also called
statistical theory branch applied mathematics uses
probability theory analysis examine theoretical basisstatistics

use statistical method valid systempopulation consideration satisfies basic mathematical
assumption method misuse statistic produce subtleserious error description interpretationsubtle even
experienced professional sometimes make error seriousmay affect social policy medical practicereliability structure bridge nuclear power plants

even statistic correctly applied result difficult
interpret nonexpert example statistical
significance trend datawhich measure extenttrend could caused random variation samplemay
agree one intuitive sense significance setbasic statistical skill skepticism needed people dealinformation everyday life referred statistical

statistical methods

experimental observational studies

common goal statistical research project investigate
causality particular draw conclusion effectchange value predictor independent variableresponse dependent variable two major type causal
statistical study experimental study observational studytype study effect difference independent
variable variable behaviour dependent variableobserved difference two type studyactually conducted effective

experimental study involves taking measurement systemstudy manipulating system taking additional measurements
using procedure determine manipulation maymodified value measurement contrast observational
study doe involve experimental manipulation instead datagathered correlation predictor responseinvestigated

example experimental study famous hawthorne studies

measured productivity plant modified illuminationarea plant see change illumination would affect
productivity due error experimental procedure specifically

criticism

general perception statistical knowledgealltoofrequently intentionally misused finding way interpret
data favorable presenter famous quote
variously attributed thought benjamin disraelithree type lieslies damn lie statisticwellknown book lie statistic darrell huff discusses
many case deceptive statistic focusing misleading
graph choosing rejecting modifying certain sample
result manipulated throwing outlier one meanmay result outright fraud subtleunintentional bias part researcher

study contradict previously announced result people may
become wary trusting study one might read study says
example reduce high blood pressure followed study
say doe affect high blood pressure followedstudy say actually worsens high blood pressure often
study conducted different group different
protocol smallsample study promised intriguing resultheld scrutiny largesample study however many
reader may noticed distinction medium mayoversimplified vital contextual information publics
distrust statistic thereby increased

however deeper criticism come fact hypothesis
testing approach widely used many case required lawregulation force one hypothesis favored null
hypothesis also seem exaggerate importance minor
difference large study difference highly statistically
significant still practical significance

field psychology medicine especially regardapproval new drug treatment food drug administration
criticism hypothesis testing approach increased recent
year one response greater emphasis pvaluesimply reporting whether hypothesis rejected given
level significancehere however summarisesevidence effect size effect one increasingly
common approach report confidence interval instead sinceindicate size effect uncertainty surrounding
