notable characteristics

heaviest alkaline earth metal radium intensely
radioactive resembles barium chemical behaviour metal
found minute quantity uranium ore pitchblendevarious uranium mineral radium preparation remarkablemaintaining higher temperature surroundings
radiation three kind alpha particles
beta particle gamma ray radium also produce neutronmixed beryllium

freshly prepared pure radium metal brilliant whiteblackens exposed air probably due nitride formation
radium luminescent giving faint blue colour reacts violently
water form radium hydroxide slightly volatilebarium

applications
