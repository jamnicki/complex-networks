treatment typically consists aggressive rehydration replacement
electrolyte since death rate generally high dueserious dehydration caused illness

tetracycline antibiotic may role reducing durationseverity cholera although drugresistance occurringeffect overall mortality questioned antibioticused include ciprofloxacin azithromycin

prevention

everyone especially traveller aware diseasetransmitted done prevent
simple sanitation usually sufficient stop epidemicseveral point along transmission path spread mayhalted
