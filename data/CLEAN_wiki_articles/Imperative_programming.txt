history

earliest imperative language machine languageoriginal computer language instruction simple
made hardware implementation easier hindered creationcomplex program fortran developed john backus ibm startingwa first major programming language remove obstacles
presented machine code creation complex program fortran
wa compiled language allowed named variable complex
expression subprogram many feature commonimperative language next two decade saw developmentnumber major highlevel imperative programming languagelate algol developed order allow
mathematical algorithm easily expressed even servedoperating system target language computer cobol 
basicwere attempt make programming syntax look
like english pascal developed niklaus wirth
c created dennis ritchie working bell
laboratory wirth went design modula modula oberon
need united state department defense jean ichbiah
team honeywell began designing ada inafter year
project define requirement language specification
wa first published inwith revision inand 

saw rapid growth interest objectoriented
programming language imperative style added
feature support object last two decade century
saw development considerable number programming
language smalltalk originally conceived alan kay inwas
released inby xerox palo alto research centre drawingconcept another objectoriented languagesimulaconsidered world first objectoriented programming
language developed late sbjarne stroustrup designed
c objectoriented language based c first implemented
inin late notable imperative languages
drawing objectoriented concept perl released larry wall
inpython released guido van rossum inphp releasedrasmus lerdorf inand java first released sun microsystems
