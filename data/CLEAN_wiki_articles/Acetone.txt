uses

important industrial use acetone involves reactionphenol manufacture bisphenol bisphenol important
component many polymer polycarbonates polyurethaneepoxy resin acetone also used extensively safe
transporting storing acetylene vessel containing porous
material first filled acetone followed acetylenedissolve acetone one liter acetone dissolve around
liter acetylene

acetone often primary component nail polish
remover acetonitrile another organic solvent sometimes usedwell acetone also used superglue remover usedthinning cleaning fibreglass resin epoxy strong
solvent plastic synthetic fibres

additionally acetone extremely effective used cleaning
agent dealing permanent marker also acetone usedartistic agent rubbed back laser print laser
photocopy produce rough ready effect

acetone used manufacture cordite world warnew process producing acetone bacterial fermentationdeveloped chaim weizmann first president israel orderhelp british war effort

acetone also dissolve many plastic including usedconsumertargeted nalgene bottle acetone also used drying
agent due readiness mix watervolatility

laboratory acetone used polar aprotic solventvariety organic reaction reactions

another industrial application use general purpose
cleaner paint ink manufacturing operations

use automotive fuel additive

health effects

acetone irritant inhalation may lead hepatotoxic effects
causing liver damage fume avoided always use goggles
handling acetone cause permanent eye damagecorneal
clouding

small amount acetone metabolically produced body mainly
fat human fasting significantly increase endogenous
production see ketosis acetone elevated diabetes
contamination water food milk air acetonevolatile lead chronic exposure acetone number acute
poisoning case described relatively speaking acetonetoxic compound however damage mucosamouth irritate damage skin accidental intake large
amount acetone may lead unconsciousness death

effect longterm exposure acetone known mostlyanimal study kidney liver nerve damage increased birth
