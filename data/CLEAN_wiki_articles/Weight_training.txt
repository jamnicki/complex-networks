basic principles

basic principle weight training involves manipulationnumber rep set tempo exercise type weight moved cause
desired increase strength endurance size shape repetition
rep act lifting lowering weightcontrolled manner set consists series repetitions
performed continuously without rest rep different exercises
target different muscle muscle group specific combinations
rep set exercise weight depends upon aimindividual performing exercise set fewer repperformed heavier weight reduced impact endurance

according popular theory
set one five repetition primarily develop strengthle impact muscle size none endurance
set six twelve repetition develop balance strength
muscle size endurance
set thirteen twenty repetition develop enduranceincrease muscle size limited impact strength
set twenty repetition consideredaerobic exercise

individual typically perform one six set per exercise onethree exercise per muscle group short break set
duration break determines energy system body

benefits

benefit weight training include greater muscular strength
improved muscle tone appearance increased endurance enhanced bone
density improved cardiovascular fitness

many people take weight training improve physical
attractiveness men develop substantial muscle women

lower starting point ultimately individual genetics dictateresponse weight training stimuli

body basal metabolic rate increase increase muscle
mass promotes longterm fat loss help dieter avoid yoyo
dieting moreover intense workout elevate metabolism several
hour following workout also promotes fat loss

weight training also provides functional benefit stronger muscles

common concerns

weight training bodybuilding

although weight training similar bodybuilding quite
different goal bodybuilder compete bodybuilding competitiontrain maximize muscular size develop extremely low
level body fat contrast weight trainer train improve
strength anaerobic endurance giving special
attention reducing body fat normal weight trainer tendfocus compound exercise build basic strength whereas
bodybuilder often use isolation exercise visually separatemuscle improve muscular symmetry

however bodybuilding community source manyweight training principle technique vocabulary customs

nutrition relevant weight trainers

people think dieting term weight loss weight
trainer also adjust diet improve resultworkout adequate protein required building skeletal muscle
various source advise weight trainer consume high protein diet
anywhere fromtog protein per pound body weight per
daytog per protein needed cell growth
repair consumed energy converted liver fat
stored body people believe high
protein diet entail risk kidney damage study shownkidney problem occur people previous kidney disease

light balanced meal consumed prior workout usually one two
hour beforehand ensures adequate energy amino acidavailable perform intense bout exercise water consumed
throughout course workout prevent poor performance duedehydration protein shake often consumed immediately following
workout protein uptake protein usageincreased time glucose another simple sugar often
consumed well since quickly replenishes glycogen lost
exercise period see gainer weight trainer also take
supplement creatine aid muscle growth howevereffectiveness product disputed others potentially
harmful

woman train weight look bulky

woman able develop large muscle regardlessprogram follow simply lack testosterone requiredachieve normally achieved look similar
fitness model muscle denser fat someonebuild muscle keeping body weight look slimmer

result obtained female bodybuilder extremely atypical
selfselected genetic ability build muscle
perform enormous amount exercise musculature exaggerated
low body fat like many male bodybuilder result may
enhanced anabolic steroid unless woman dedicates lifebodybuilding achieve result professional
bodybuilder

light highrepetition exercise effective toning muscles

weight trainer perform light highrepetition exerciseattempt tone muscle without increasing sizecome misunderstanding meaning wordtonepeople refer toned physique one combine reasonable
muscular size moderate level body fat use word
tone sense inaccurate appropriate term woulddefinition

muscle tone physiologic term refers constant
lowfrequency contraction occur muscle time even
rest prepare future activity continuous
slight tension torso muscle contributes maintaining good
posture highrepetition exercise increase muscle sizeimprove latter type muscle tone even performedaerobic exercise limited benefit since aerobic
exercise effective engages whole body

define muscle requires combination weight training increase
muscle size cardiovascular training reduce bodyfat levels

weight training safe children
