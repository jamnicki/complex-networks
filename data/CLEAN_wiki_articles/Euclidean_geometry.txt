axiomatic approach

following precedent set element euclidean geometry haexposited axiomatic system theorem true
statement derived finite number axiom nearbeginning first book element euclid give five
postulate axioms
two point joined straight line
straight line segment extended indefinitelystraight line
given straight line segment circle drawnsegment radius one endpoint centre
right angle congruent
parallel postulate two line intersect third way
sum inner angle one side two right
angle two line inevitably must intersectside extended far enough

axiom invoke following concept point straight line
segment line side line circle radius centre right
angle congruence inner right angle sum following verbs
appear join extend draw intersect circle describedpostulateis tacitly unique postulatesandhold plane

unmarked straightedge sense euclidean geometryconcrete many modern axiomatic system set theoryoften assert existence object without saying construct
even assert existence object probably cannotconstructed within theory

element also include following five common notions
thing equal thing also equal one another
equal added equal whole equal
equal subtracted equal remainderequal
thing coincide one another equal one another
whole greater part

parallel postulate

ancient parallel postulate seemed obviousothers verifying physically would require inspect two lines
check never intersected even distant point
inspection could potentially take infinite amount time
euclid seems considered qualitatively
different others evidenced organizationelement firstpropositions presentproved without
many geometer tried vain prove fifth postulatefirst four byat leastdifferent proof published

postulate replaced conflicting axiom one distinguishing aspect
system three angle triangle addhyperbolic geometry sum three angle always less
thanand approach zero elliptic geometrygreater thanif parallel postulate dropped list
axiom without replacement result general geometry
called absolute geometry
