cylinder versus discs

era world war phonograph cylinder disc records
competed public favour

audio fidelity sound groove inherently betterengraved either disc cylinder competition duefactors

advantage cylinders

cylinder system certain advantage noted wax cylinders
could used home recording indestructible type couldplayed many time disc cylinder usually
rotated greater speed disc creating greater linear
velocity stylus groove theory would giveadvantage better audio fidelity furthermore since constant angular
velocity translates constant linear velocity radiusspiral track constant cylinder also free inner groove
problem suffered disc recording aroundcylinders average
indeed notably higher audio quality contemporary discs
disc maker improved technology bythe fidelity
difference better disc cylinder became minimal

cylinder phonograph also usually used worm gear move stylus
synchronization groove recording whereas disc
machine relied groove pull stylus along resulted
cylinder record played number time degradation
disc added mechanism made cylinder machineexpensive

advantage discs

disc record machine play cheapermassproduce product cylinder system disc records
also easier cheaper store bulk couldstacked paper sleeve put row shelf like books

many cylinder phonograph used belt turn mandrel slight
slippage belt could make mandrel turn evenly thus
resulting pitch fluctuation disc phonograph using direct system
gear could really turn unevenly heavy metal turntabledisc machine acted flywheel helping minimize speed wobble

incolumbia record introduced mass production disc records
recording pressed side soon became industry
standard patron disc record could get two recording less
price one cylinder

mention also made superior advertising promotion
done disc company notably victor talking machine
company united state gramophone company hmvcommonwealth great singer like enrico caruso hired record
exclusively helping put idea public mindcompany product superior

end cylinders

cylinder recording continued compete growing disc record
market disc commercial battledecade columbia making disc cylinders
switched exclusively disc edison started marketingdisc record however edison continued sell new cylinder recordconsumer cylinder phonograph machine throughthe latestnew cylinder simply dub disc recordlower fidelity disc versions

later application phonograph cylinder technology

cylinder phonograph technology continued used dictaphone
recording office use early
indictaphone replaced wax cylinder dictabelt
technology cut mechanical groove plastic belt instead
wax cylinder later replaced magnetic tape
