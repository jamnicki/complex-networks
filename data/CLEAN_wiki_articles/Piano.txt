pedals

piano pedal close equivalent since earliest
day century piano used lever pressed upwardplayer knee instead pedal three pedal become
le standard modern piano following

damper pedal also called sustaining pedal loud pedaloften simply called pedal since frequently used
placed rightmost pedal group every stringpiano except top two octave equipped damperpadded device prevents string vibrating damperraised string whenever key note presseddamper pedal pressed damper piano liftedevery string vibrate serf two purposes
first assist pianist producing legato playing smoothly
connected note passage fingering available make
otherwise possible second raising damper pedal causestring vibrate sympathetically whichever noteplayed greatly enriches piano tone
piano pedal left right una corda sostenuto damper

sensitive pedaling one technique pianist must master
since piano music chopin onwards tends benefit extensive
use sustaining pedal mean achieving singing
tone aid legato contrast sustaining pedalused sparingly composer century including
haydn mozart early work beethoven era pedalling
