intrinsic versus extrinsic

initially middle nineteenth century differential
geometry studied extrinsic point view curvesurface considered lying euclidean space higher
dimension example surface ambient space three
dimension simplest result differential
geometry curve starting work riemann intrinsic
point view developed one cannot speak moving
outside geometric object considered givenfreestanding way

intrinsic point view flexible example useful
relativity spacetime cannot naturally taken extrinsic
would outside intrinsic point viewharder define central concept curvature structures
connection price pay

two point view reconciled extrinsic geometry
considered structure additional intrinsic one see
