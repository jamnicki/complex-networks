prevention

tb prevention control take two parallel approach first
people contact identified treated
identification infection often involves testing highrisk groups
tb second approach child vaccinated protecttb unfortunately vaccine available provides reliable
protection adult however tropical area incidence
atypical mycobacteria high exposure nontuberculous
mycobacteria give protection 
vaccines

many country use bcg vaccine part control programs
