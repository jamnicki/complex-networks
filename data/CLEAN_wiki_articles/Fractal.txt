colloquial usage fractal rough fragmented geometric
shape subdivided part least
approximately reducedsize copy whole term coined
benot mandelbrot inand derived latin fractus
meaning broken fractured

fractal geometric object generally following features
fine structure arbitrarily small scales
irregular easily described traditional euclidean
geometric language
selfsimilar least approximatively stochastically
ha hausdorff dimension greater topological
dimension although requirement met spacefilling
curve hilbert curve
ha simple recursive definition

due appearing similar level magnification fractals
often considered infinitely complex obvious examples

following analysis koch snowflake suggestsselfsimilarity used analyze fractal properties

total length number small step product applied boundary koch snowflake give boundless
