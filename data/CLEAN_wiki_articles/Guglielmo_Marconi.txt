radio work

growing marconi intense early interest sciencewa especially fascinated electricity one important
scientific development era came heinrich hertzbeginning inbecame first person demonstrate devicecould produce detect electromagnetic radiationnow known radio
wave time commonly called hertzian wave hertzs
death inbrought published review earlier discoveryrenewed interest part marconi permitted briefly
study subject augusto righi university bologna

investigator exploring various wireless telegraph
technology overyears none yet proven commercially
successful marconi developed system following main
components
relatively simple sparkgap radio transmitter closely
modeled one designed righi turn similarhertz used
telegraph key used operate transmitter send shortlong pulse corresponding dotsanddashes morse code
coherer receiver modification edouard branlys
original device refinement made sensitivereliable
telegraph register activated coherer recordedtransmitted morse code dotsanddashes onto roll paper tape

similar configuration using sparkgap transmitter plus
cohererreceivers tried experimenterunable achieve transmission range hundred
metre first marconi could signal similar limited
distance however summer ofhe moved experimentation
outdoors increasing length transmitter receiver
antenna arranging vertically stumbled across fact
one end antenna allowed touch groundtransmission range increased significantly although marconiunderstand reason time ground connection allowed
earth act waveguide surface wave signal soonwa able transmit signal crest hill distance
approximatelykilometresmile point became
convinced additional funding research device would
become capable spanning even greater distance thus would prove
valuable commercially military use
