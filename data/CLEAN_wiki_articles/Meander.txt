meander bend river also known oxbow loop stream
river flowing wide valley flat plain tend form
meandering stream course alternatively erodes deposits
sediment along course result snaking patternstream meander back forth across floodplain meander
get cut main stream body oxbow lake formed

meander formed river flow faster outside edge
small curve slower along inside edge depositionsediment occurs inner edge river moving slowly
cannot carry sediment load creating slipoff slope faster
moving current outside bend erosive abilitymeander tends grow direction outside bend formingriver cliff seen area willow grow banks
river inside meander willow often farbank whilst outside bend root willowoften exposed undercut eventually leading tree fallriver demonstrates river movement
