society organize distinction differently thus proposeddescribe kin term terminology either descriptiveclassificatory descriptive term refer one typerelationship classificatory term refer many typerelationship kinship terminology include descriptiveclassificatory term example western society provide one
way express relationship one brother brotherparents
son thus western society word brother functiondescriptive term many different way exist express relationship

sister son father brother son father sister sonthus western society word cousin operatesclassificatory term

morgan discovered descriptive term one society becomeclassificatory term another society example societies
one would refer many different people mother womangave birth oneself well sister husband sisteralso one father sister moreover society lump

generation
sudanese descriptive two relative shareterm
eskimo classificatory descriptive term addition
sex generation also distinguishes lineal relatives
related directly line descent collateral
relative related blood directly linedescent lineal relative highly descriptive terms
collateral relative highly classificatory terms
iroquois classificatory descriptive termaddition sex generation also distinguishes siblings
opposite sex parental generation siblingsex class blood relative sibling opposite sex
count relative marriage thus one call one mothers
