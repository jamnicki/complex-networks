debate authorship

one long standing academic debate citizen kane hanature authorship original screenplay opening
credit attribute welles herman mankiewicz

famously film critic pauline kael essay entitled raising
kane originally published new yorker inand later
reprinted citizen kane book omnibus collectionkeep claim welles downplayed veteran screenwriter herman mankiewiczs contribution kael argues mankiewicz true
author screenplay therefore responsible muchmade movie great angered many critic daynotably criticturnedfilmmaker close friend welles peter
bogdanovich rebutted many kaels claims

subsequently robert carringer aessay entitledscript citizen kane hisbook making citizen
kane refutes kaels claim mankiewicz sole authorscreenplay thorough analysis seven script revisionfilm carringer found film dual credit wellesmankiewicz accurate script revision clearly indicatedifferent contribution author contributions

filmmaking innovations

film scholar historian view citizen kane welles attemptcreate new style filmmaking studying various form movie
making combining one much like griffithbirth nation inwelles acting style also seen
early example method acting example scene kane
vent anger top staircase political opponent
jim gettys welles tripped chipped anklebone filming
scene camera continued roll shot madefinal print film view examplewelles workhorse ethic director welles disliked actorsubscribed method acting considering unreliable particular
dismissed practice internalizing hindrance rather
contributing production whole liked workactor malleable vision always prepared changedelivery drop hat without much worry motivation
welles actor frequently practiced cold reading spenttime memorizing line never took long mental
prep work commonly agreed however instancecitizen kane welles became consumed role one famous
scene movie kane destroys second wife bedroombare hand left according biographerwelles destroyed room shooting finished stumbled set
bloody hand muttering felt felt
innovative technical aspect citizen kaneunprecedented use deep focus nearly every scene filmforeground background everything sharp
focus done renowned cinematographer gregg tolandexperimentation lens lighting specifically toland
often used telephoto lens shoot closeup scene anytime deep
focus impossiblefor example scene kane finishbad review alexander opera time firingperson started reviewtoland used optical printer make
whole screen appear focus one piece film printed onto
another piece film however many deep focus shot result
incamera effect famous example scene kane
break susan alexander room suicide attemptbackground kane another man break roomsimultaneously medicine bottle glass spooncloseup foreground shot incamera matte shotforeground shot first background darkbackground lit foreground darkened film rewoundscene reshot background action

another unorthodox method used film way lowangle shots
used display point view facing upwards thus allowing
ceiling shown background several scene since movies
primarily filmed sound stage locationera hollywood studio system impossible filmangle showed ceiling stage none welles crew
used muslin draped set produce illusion regular
room ceiling boom mike hidden cloth

one storytelling technique introduced film using
episodic sequence set character changed
costume makeup cut scene following cut
would look took place location time long
previous cut way welles chronicled breakdownkanes first marriage took year story time matterminute prior technique filmmaker often use long
period screen time explain character changed circumstances
example erich von stroheim masterpiece greed breakdown
marriage main character take almost hour screen
time even abbreviated cut

welles also pioneered several visual effect order cheaply shoot
thing like crowd scene large interior space examplescene camera opera house rise dramaticallyrafter show workman showing lack appreciationsecond kanes performance shot panning camera upwards
performance scene curtain wipe miniatureupper region house another curtain wipe matchingscene workman scene effectively employed
miniature make film look much expensive trulyvarious shot xanadu

film broke new ground use special effect makeup
believably ageing cast many decade course story
detail extended hazy contact lens make cottens eyes
look rheumy old man welles later claimed dashing
appearance young man also involved lot makeup includingstrategically applied tape give mini facelift

welles brought experience sound radio alongfilmmaking producing layered complex soundtrack one famous
scene elderly kane strike susan tent beachtwo character silently glower woman nearby
party heard hysterically laughing backgroundgiddiness grotesque counterpoint misery susan kane
elsewhere welles skillfully employed sound effect createmoodsuch chilly echo monumental libraryreporter confronted intimidating officious librarian

addition expanding potential sound creatormood emotion welles pioneered new aural technique knownlightningmix welles used technique link complex montage
sequence via series related sound phrase offeringcontinuous sound track welles able join would otherwiseextremely rough cut together smooth narrative exampleaudience witness kane grow child young man two
shot kanes guardian hand sled wish merry
christmas suddenly taken shot kane fifteen year later
phrase completed happy new yearcase continuity soundtrack screenmake seamless narrative structure cook 

welles also carried technique radio yet popularmovie though would become staple using number voices
saying sentence sometimes merely fragment sentence
splicing dialogue together quick succession result gave
impression whole town talkingand equally importanttown talking welles also favored overlappingdialogue considering realistic stage movie
tradition character stepping others sentence also
pioneered technique putting audio ahead visualscene transition scene would come close audio would
transition next scene visual
