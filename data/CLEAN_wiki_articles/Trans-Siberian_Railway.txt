effects

transsiberian railway gave great boost siberian agriculture
facilitating substantial export central russia europeinfluenced territory connected directly wellconnected river transport instance altai krai exported
wheat railway via river

siberian agriculture began export cheap grain towards west
agriculture central russia still economic pressureend serfdom formally cancelled inthusdefend central territory prevent possible social
destabilization inthe government introduced chelyabinsk
tariff breaka tariff barrier grain
passing chelyabinsk similar barrier manchuriameasure changed nature export mill emerged create bread
grain altai novosibirsk tomsk many farm switchedbutter production fromuntillsiberia exported averagely
tonnespood bread grain flour annually

transsiberian line remains important transportation link
within russia aroundof russian export travel lineattracts many foreign tourist also get considerable usedomestic passengers
