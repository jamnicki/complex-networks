ancient weapons

basic task weapon must perform changed since ancient
time weapon one following
concentrate pressure sharp end broken stone pointed
stick apply force per unit area harmblunt end material hardness determines abilityapply resist pressure
store energy object accumulates kinetic energy person
accelerates release energy much shorter time
frame upon impact thus magnifying person power
project force thrown rock long stick allows personaffect adversary distance

shown preceding example even simple item rockstick often serve function better human bodyusefulness tool made development paramount importance
humanity consisting small thinly spread huntergatherer
community first known trace weapon stone age
flint knife handaxes head large dartevidence handaxes thrown good evidenceused butcher animal instead dart seempowerful projectile weapon anthropologist thrown reconstructed
dart several inch oak using atlatls broad

weapon probably much older dart although little
early evidence exists include sling spear
even though weapon quite simple major military
weapon least roman time unit fastmoving skirmishers

understandable sling prone decay woulddifficult prove particular stone used ammunition
similarly incentive put stone point onto spear
dart weighted spear point liability ratherasset greater momentum imparted stabbing make sharpness

information warfare

modern warfare since redoubt trap maneuvercoordination force decisive overshadowing particular weapons
goal every modern commander therefore operate withinobservationdecisionaction cycle enemy waymodern commander bring overwhelming force bear isolated
group enemy tactically overwhelm enemy

traditional military maneuver tried achieve coordinationfront made line military asset formerlyway prevent harm friendly force closeorder marching drill
traditional military skill early method get relative
superiority coordination derivative method leapfrogging
unit advance line survived combined arm warfarecoordinate aircraft artillery armor infantry

computer changing extreme example faris
