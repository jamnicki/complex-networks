discovery

spectroscopic study first revealed presence planet around novemberastronomers made careful photometric
measurement several star known orbited planethope might observe dip brightness caused transit
planet across star face would require planets
orbit inclined would pas earthstar previously transit detected

soon discovery separate team one led david charbonneau
including timothy brown others gregory henry
