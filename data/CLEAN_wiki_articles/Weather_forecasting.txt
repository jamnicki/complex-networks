history weather forecasting

millennium people tried forecast weather inbcbabylonian predicted weather cloud pattern aboutbc
aristotle described weather pattern meteorologica chinese weather
prediction lore extends least far back asbc

ancient weather forecasting method usually relied observed patterns
event example might observed sunsetparticularly red following day often brought fair weatherexperience accumulated generation produce weather lore
however prediction prove reliable manysince found stand rigorous statistical testing

modern day weather forecasting system

component modern weather forecasting system include
data collection
data assimilation
numerical weather prediction
model output postprocessing
forecast presentation enduser

data collection

observation atmospheric pressure temperature wind speed wind
direction humidity precipitation made near earth surfacetrained observer automatic weather station buoy world
meteorological organization act standardize instrumentation
observing practice timing observation worldwide
station either report hourly metar report every six hoursynop reports

measurement temperature humidity wind surfacefound launching radiosondesweather balloon data usually
obtained near surface middle stratospheremft recent year data transmittedcommercial airplane amdar system alsoincorporated upper air observation primarily numerical models

increasingly data weather satellite used duealmost global coverage although visible light imageuseful forecaster see development cloud littleinformation used numerical weather prediction modelinfrared data however used give informationtemperature surface cloud top individual cloud also
tracked one time next provide information wind
direction strength cloud steering level polar orbiting
satellite provide sounding temperature moisture throughoutdepth atmosphere compared similar data radiosondes
satellite data advantage coverage global however
accuracy resolution good

meteorological radar provide information precipitation locationintensity additionally doppler radar used wind speeddirection determined

data assimilation

data assimilation process information gainedobservation used conjunction numerical modelrecent forecast time observation made sincecontains information previous observation producemeteorological analysis best estimate current state

model output post processing

raw output often modified presentedforecast form statistical technique remove
known bias model adjustment take account
consensus among numerical weather forecasts

past human forecaster used responsible generating

presentation weather forecasts

final stage forecasting process perhapsimportant knowledge end user need weather forecast
must taken account present information usefulunderstandable way

public information

one main end user forecast general public
thunderstorm cause strong wind dangerous lightning strikes
leading death power outage widespread hail damage heavy
snow rain bring transportation commerce standstillwell cause flooding lowlying area excessive heat cold waves
kill sicken without adequate utility national
weather service provides forecast watcheswarningsadvisoriesarea united state protect life propertymaintain commercial interest environment canada responsibledispensing similar forecast warning public canada
traditionally television radio weather presentermain method informing public however increasingly internet
used due vast amount information found

air traffic

aviation industry especially sensitive weather fog
andor exceptionally low ceiling prevent many aircraft landingtaking similarly turbulence icing hazard whilstflight thunderstorm problem aircraft due severe
turbulence icing well large hail strong windlightning cause fatal damage aircraftflight day day basis airliner routed take advantagejet stream tailwind improve fuel efficiency air crewbriefed prior take condition expect routedestination

marine

utility companies

electricity gas company rely weather forecast anticipate
demand strongly affected weather winter severe
cold weather cause surge demand people turnheating similarly summer surge demand linkedincreased use air conditioning system hot weatheranticipating surge demand utility company purchase
additional supply power natural gas price increases
circumstance supply restricted

private sector

increasingly private company pay weather forecast tailoredneed increase profit avoid large
loss example supermarket chain may change stockshelf anticipation different consumer spending habitdifferent weather condition state department transportationprivate road maintenance company also use forecastdemonstrate best effort defending lawsuit result
traffic accidents

military applications

similarly private sector military weather forecaster present
weather condition war fighter community equally provide
preflight weather brief flight weather brief taketerminal location including update throughout flight path also
military weather forecaster provide real time resource protection
service military installation covered national
weather service three military branch independent weather
forecasting technique tailored specific need example
naval forecaster cover water ship weather forecast air
force forecaster cover air operation wartime peacetime
operation provide army support coast guard forecaster provide
ship forecast ice breaker various operation within

aviation asset silent cooperative agreementcivilian forecaster military forecaster working unison

persistence forecasting

simplest method forecasting weather persistence relies upon
today condition forecast condition tomorrowvalid way forecasting weather steady statesummer season tropic method forecasting
strongly depends upon presence stagnant weather patternuseful short range forecast long range forecasts

nowcasting

referred nowcasting range human
forecaster still advantage computer nwp modeltime range possible forecast smaller featureindividual shower cloud reasonable accuracy howeveroften small resolved computer model human givenlatest radar satellite observational data able makebetter analysis small scale feature present able

ensemble forecasting

although forecast model predict realistic looking weather
feature evolving realistically distant future errorforecast inevitably grow time due chaotic natureatmosphere detail given forecast therefore
decrease time error increase becomes point
error large forecast completely wrongforecast atmospheric state correlation actual state
atmosphere

however looking single forecast give indication likely
forecast correct ensemble forecasting lotforecast produced reflect uncertainty initial stateatmosphere due error observation insufficient
sampling uncertainty forecast assessedrange different forecast produced shownbetter detecting possibility extreme event long range
