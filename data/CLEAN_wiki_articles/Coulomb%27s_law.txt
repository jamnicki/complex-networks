coulomb law developed french physicist charles
augustin coulomb may stated follows

magnitude electrostatic force two point chargedirectly proportional magnitude charge inversely
proportional square distance charges

analogous newton third law motion mechanicformula coulomb law form newton gravitational

force act line connecting two charged objects
charged object polarity repel along line
charged object opposite polarity attract alongline connecting
coulomb law also interpreted term atomic unitforce expressed hartrees per bohr radius charge termelementary charge distance term bohr radius
