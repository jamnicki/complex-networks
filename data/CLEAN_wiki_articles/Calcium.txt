calcium naturally found elemental state calcium found
mostly soil system limestone gypsum fluorite stalagmites
stalactite contain calcium carbonate essential
macromineral human diet soil conservation practice often
consider sustainable equilibrium calcium concentrationearth

applications

us include
reducing agent extraction metaluranium zirconium thorium
deoxidizer desulfurizer decarbonizer various ferrous
nonferrous alloys
alloying agent used production aluminium
beryllium copper lead magnesium alloys
making cement mortar used construction
