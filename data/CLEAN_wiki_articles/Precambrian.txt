overview

remarkably little known precambrian despite makingroughly seveneighths earth history little known
ha largely discovered past four five decades

thought earth coalesced material orbit

marssized planetesimal shortly formed splittingmaterial came together form moon see giant impact theory
stable crust apparently place byma since zircon
crystal western australia dated atma

term precambrian somewhat dated still common use
among geologist paleontologist briefly also calledcryptozoic eon seems likely eventually replacedpreferred term proterozoic archaean hadean becomedeprecated term see geologic time scale
