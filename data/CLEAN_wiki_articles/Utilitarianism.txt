two sovereign master pleasure pain derivedrule utility good whatever brings greatest
happiness greatest number people later realizingformulation recognized two different potentially conflicting
principle dropped second part talked simplygreatest happiness principle

jeremy bentham foremost proponent james mill significant
philosopher day father john stuart mill johneducated according bentham principlesincluding transcribingsummarising much father work whilst still teens

famous short book utilitarianism john stuart mill argued
cultural intellectual spiritual pleasure greater
value mere physical pleasure former would valued
highly competent judge latter competent judge
according mill anyone experienced lower
pleasure higher like bentham formulation mills
utilitarianism hedonistic deal pleasurehappiness

classic utilitarianism bentham mill influenced manyphilosopher development broader conceptconsequentialism result exist many different accounts
good therefore many different type consequentialism
besides utilitarianism example philosopher reject sole
importance wellbeing argue intrinsic values
happiness pleasure knowledge autonomy

past advocate utilitarianism include william godwin henry
sidgwick modernday advocate include hare peter singer

utilitarianism used argument many different
political view essay liberty work john stuart
mill argued utilitarianism requires political arrangements
satisfy liberty principle according purpose
power rightfully exercised membercivilised community prevent harm others
prevention selfharm person expressly forbidden
although utilitarian happiness mean mill state selfharmgood reason person remonstrate try persuade
person
ludwig von advocated libertarianism using utilitarian arguments
likewise marxist philosopher also used principleargument political socialism

type utilitarianism

negative utilitarianism

utilitarian theory deal producing greatest amountgood greatest number negative utilitarianism requires promote least amount evil harm prevent greatest
amount harm greatest number proponent argueeffective ethical formula since contend greatest harms
consequential greatest good founder referred epistemological argument add clarityfield ethic formulate demand negatively iedemand elimination suffering rather promotionhappiness karl rpopper open society enemy london
practical implementation idea following
version distinguished

advocate utilitarian principle quick suggest
ultimate aim would engender quickest least
painful method killing entirety humanity ultimately
would effectively minimize pain would seem calldestruction world even avoid pain pinprick 

newer moderate version attempt minimize kinds
suffering kind created frustration
preference supporter moderate preferencesurvive stronger wish freed sufferingrefuse idea quick painless destruction lifebelieve time worst case sufferingdefeated world minor suffering realized principal
agent direction found environmenttranshumanism 

supporter moderate believe promisetranshumanism would prefer reduction populationextreme case empty world seems come position
radical moderate world could sacrificedprevent extreme suffering avoid pain pinprickpreference empty world doe follow corresponding
political claim claim would definitely analogyradical counterproductive pessimistic supporter moderate therefore tend towards retreat oriented way living

finally theoretician see branch within
classical utilitarianism demanding higher priority fight
sufferingthis interpretation though cannot countedindependent version doe avoid derek parfits
repugnant conclusionnu precisely characterized overcoming
theoretical weakness classical utilitarianism

act utilitarianism rule utilitarianism

act utilitarianism state faced choice must first
consider likely consequence potential actionchoose believe generate happiness rule
utilitarian hand begin looking potential ruleaction determine whether rule followed lookwould happen constantly followed adherencerule produce happiness otherwise rule morally
must followed time distinction act rule
utilitarianism therefore based difference proper
object consequentialist calculation individual action rules

illustrate consider following thought experimentcompared survival lottery scenario trolley problemsurgeon five terminal patient one need liver one needpancreas one need heart two need kidney sixth
nonterminal patient came appendix removedsurgeon kill sixth man pas organ aroundothers

act utilitarian would consider probable consequencesacrificing sixth patient particular occasion rule
utilitarian would look consequence performingsacrifice every time situation arises one potential rule would
whenever surgeon could kill one relatively healthy personorder transplant organ one person needs
ought instituted society rule would
obviously lead bad consequence relatively healthy people would
stop going hospital many risky transplant operation wouldperformed etc therefore rule utilitarian would sayimplement opposite rule dont harvest healthy people organgive sick people rule utilitarian therefore would
immoral surgeon kill sixth man coursepossible act utilitarian would decide sacrificesixth man would agree rule utiltarianism would provide
stronger reason
rule utilitarianism criticized advocating general rules
specific circumstance clearly decrease happinessfollowed never kill human might seem good rulecould make defense aggressor difficult rule utilitarians
would add general exception rule allowbreaking rule increase happiness one exampleselfdefense critic would argue reduces rule
utilitarianism act utilitarianism rule become meaningless
rule utilitarian respond rule legal system law regulate situation meaningless instance
selfdefense legally justified murder
rule utilitarianism confused rule thumb many
act utilitarian agree make sense formulate certain rules
thumb follow find situationconsequence difficult costly timeconsuming calculate
exactly consequence calculated relatively clearlywithout much doubt rule thumb ignored

course utilitarianism instructs find one actionbest improve future experience merely old actpositive net benefit matter slight dicey thus
utilitarian act rule stripe energeticseeking finding better alternatives

motive utilitarianism

approach interesting hybrid act rule
utilitarianism first developed robert adam motive
utilitarianism journal philosophywhich attempt deal
realistically human function psychologicallyindeed passionate emotional much better positive
goal rather negative prohibition forth motive
utilitarianism proposes initial moral task inculcate
motif within generally useful acrossspectrum situation likely encounter example
similar therule business might able improve
future package experience large number activities
honest partnership others rather things
sneakily
species

peter singer along animal right activist arguedwellbeing sentient conscious feel pain
including animal deserve equal consideration given human
bentham made similar argument even utilitarians
arguing otherwise note suffering animal often cause humansuffer thus making often immoral harm animal evenanimal given moral status

combination ethical schools

order overcome perceived shortcoming system several
attempt made combine utilitarianism kants
categorical imperative instance james cornman proposesgiven situation treat mean peoplepossible treat end many people thusconsistent mean refers utilitarian
kantian principle

consequentialists may consider happiness important
consequence addition argue consequence justiceequality also valued regardless increase happiness

biological explanation utilitarianism

ha suggested sociobiology study evolutionhuman society provides support utilitarian point viewexample expanding circle ethic sociobiologyutilitarian philosopher peter singer argues fundamentally
utilitarian ethical reasoning existed time primitive
foraging band cooperate compromise make group decisions
survive elaborates dispute member cohesive
group reasoning demand reason demandjustification accepted group whole thus
consideration others interest long necessary parthuman experience singer belief reason compels equal
consideration people interests


utilitarianism

seen ethical point view one person
among many society interest important
point view whole similar interestothers within society ready see still larger
point view society one among societyinterest member society importantlarger perspective similar interest membersociety taking impartial element ethical reasoninglogical conclusion mean first accepting ought equal
concern human beings


utilitarianism

conclusionthat everybodys interest considered
equally making decisionsis core tenet utilitarianism

singer elaborates viewing oneself equal others ones
society time viewing one society fundamentally
superior society may cause uncomfortable cognitive
dissonance sense mean reason may push
people accept broader utilitarian stance critic binmore
point cognitive dissonance apparentlystrong since people often knowingly ignore interest faraway
society quite similar also note ought
quoted paragraph applies someone already
accepted premise society equally important singer
ha responded argument expanding circle wasnt intended
provide complete philosophical justification utilitarian
categorical imperative merely provide plausible explanation
people come accept utilitarianism

criticism defense utilitarianism

utilitarianism common sense morality

utilitarianism criticized leading numberconclusion contrary common sense morality example might
argued common sense one never sacrifice
human happiness human ethical position
famously explored guins modern fablethe one walk away
omelas utilitarian however argue common senseused justify many position side controversial
issue varies greatly individual individual makingunsuitable basis common morality regarding exampleequally common sense one must sacrifice soldiercivilian defensive war

comparing happiness

another difficulty utilitarianism comparing happiness
among different people many early utilitarian hopedhappiness could somehow measured quantitatively comparedpeople felicific calculus although one ever managedconstruct detailed one practice arguedhappiness different people incommensurable thus felicific
calculus impossible practice even principle
defender utilitarianism reply problem faced anyone
ha choose two alternative state affairimpose burden people involved happinessincommensurable death hundred people would worsedeath one triage example real world situationutilitarianism seems applied successfully

pleasure sadist importancepleasure altruist also criticized supporter notepractice almost decision made cater sadist
creating pleasure altruist simultaneously helppeople creating pleasure sadist simultaneously hurtpeople furthermore many utilitarian feel sadist pleasuresuperficial temporary thus detrimental sadistlong run practice therefore pleasure sadist almost
never weight significance utilitarian calculation

predicting consequences

daniel dennett example three mile island another example
difficulty calculating happiness nearmeltdownoccurred nuclear power plant good bad thing according
utilitarianism point longterm effect nuclear
policy would considered beneficial many might outweighnegative consequence conclusion still early 
year event utilitarianism weigh evidencereach definite conclusion utilitarian note utilitarianism
seems unspoken principle used advocate critics
nuclear power something cannot determined momentcommon science frequently resolved advancements

utilitarian however required perfect knowledge
indeed certain knowledge consequence impossibleconsequence unexperienced future utilitarian simply try
best maximize happiness another form utilitymake best estimate consequenceconsequence decision particularly unclear might make
sense follow ethical rule promoted utilitypast utilitarian also note people tryinginterest run situation consequencedecision unclear doe meanunable make decision

importance intentions

utilitarianism criticized looking resultaction desire intention motivatemany people also consider important action intended cause harm
inadvertently cause good result would judged equalresult action done good intention however many
utilitarian would argue utilitarianism appliesresult also desire disposition praise blame rules
institution punishment instance bad intention may cause
harm actor others even result bad
act recognized supporter argue utilitarianism
becomes much complex rich moral theory may align much
closely moral intuitions

furthermore many utilitarian view morality personal guide rather
mean judge action people actionalready performed word morality somethinglooked deciding sense intentionthing matter consequence cannot knowncertainty decision already made

one philosopher take view henry sidgwick main work
method ethic 

human rights

critic reject utilitarianism rule act basis
seems incompatible human right exampleslavery torture beneficial population wholecould theoretically justified utilitarianism utilitarian theory
thus seems overlook right minority group might also
ignore right majority man might achieve pure
ecstasy killingpeople positive utility outweighs
negative utility thepeople murdered

utilitarian may argue justification either slavery torturemass murder would require unrealistically large benefit outweigh
direct extreme suffering victim although may
support one practice justifiable consequences
achieved utilitarianism would also require indirect impactsocial acceptance inhumane policy taken consideration
example general anxiety fear might increase human
right commonly ignored

act rule utilitarianism differ treat human rights
rule utilitarianism human right easilyconsidered moral rule act utilitarian handaccept human right moral principledoe mean rejected altogether first act
utilitarian explained would agree actenslavement genocide always cause great unhappiness little
happiness second human right could considered rule thumb
although torture might acceptable circumstancerule immoral finally act utilitarian often support human
right legal sense utilitarian support law cause
good harm

sacrifice important individual interest greater sum lesser
interests

since utilitarian judge action ability maximize good
consequence harm one individual always justifiedgreater gain individual true even lossone individual large gain others marginallong enough individual receive small benefit thus
utilitarian deny individual inviolable moral rightexplained utilitarian may support legal right rightrule thumb considered inherent moralityseems problematic many critic utilitarianism one notes
according utilitarianism nothing intrinsically wrong
sacrificing important individual interest greater sumlesser interest assumption retained foundationtheory remains source moral concern

although criticism may two related criticisms
utilitarianism based misconception principlegreatest good greatest number introduced bentham often
mistaken meaning something hurt one person help many
always morally justified case however noted
bentham dropped misleading greatest number partprinciple replacing original formulation direct
greatest happiness principle thus morality actiondetermined number people made happier ratherquantity happiness produced great loss one individual mightoutweighed small gain many might even ifperson
hurt andpeople helped harm one mightgreat outweigh small gain rest people

second criticize utilitarianism implying individuals
interest sacrificed sake societynation modern utilitarianism however proposes one individuals
interest sacrificed sake interestindividual bentham put vain talk interestcommunity without understanding interestindividual may benefit individual healthy society
functional state neither end
right wrong dichotomy

criticism regard utilitarianism judgement right
wrong utilitarianism hold given situation right
act produced greatest good actwrong therefore even charitable action could considered wrong
theory example someone donatedto charity
provided starving child food person coulddonated money charity doe thingefficient created even good action wouldjudged wrong utilitarianism

response criticism nature contemporary philosopher
utilitarian william shaw claimed although utilitarianism
would clearly dictate conclusion good utilitarian would
still praise wrongdoer charitable donation even thoughwrong punishing person would likely push
longer make charitable contribution praisingwrongdoer would better serve greater good punishing
furthermore decision donate charity still morally good
even decision ignore efficiency immoral since
utilitiarianism presumes imperfect knowledge immoral behaviour
relative charity inefficiency would limiteddifficulty determining charity relative effectiveness

proof

another criticism utilitarianism proven science
logic correct ethical system however supporter claim
common ethical school indeed systemlogic remain problem regress
argument least isought problem satisfactorily solved
indeed utilitarian first recognise problem
might instead argued almost political argumentfuture society use unspoken utilitarian principle sides
claiming proposed solution one increase human
happiness degree utilitarianism might wellgenetically hardcoded humans

moral

critic also asked one follow utilitarianism insteadegoism legal system might punish behaviour hurt othersincentive active situation one personally
gain breaking others cannot punish however one egoist
may propose mean maximize selfinterest conflictmean proposed another egoist result behoovedcompromise one another avoid conflict selfinterest
mean proposed may incidentally coincide prescribedutilitarianism though foundational ethical imperative wouldcourse utilitarian

another reason egoist become utilitarian proposedpeter singer practical ethic present paradox hedonism
say goal life personal happinessnever happy need something happy one goal
singer feel likely bring personal happiness desire
improve life others argument similar onevirtue ethics

karl marx argument concerning importance human nature

karl marx capital writes

even excepting philosopher christian wolff time
country homespun commonplace ever
strutted selfsatisfied way principleutility discovery bentham simply reproduceddull way helvtius frenchman said esprit
th century know useful dog one must
study dognature nature deducedprinciple utility applying man would
criticise human act movement relation etcprinciple utility must first deal human naturegeneral human nature modifiedhistorical epoch bentham make short workdriest naivet take modern shopkeeper especiallyenglish shopkeeper normal man whatever usefulqueer normal man world absolutely useful

martin tupper etc rubbish brave fellow
motto nulla sine line piled mountainbooks

marx accusation twofold first place saytheory utility true definition thus doe really add
anything meaningful marx productive enquiry wouldinvestigate sort thing good peoplenature belief alienated capitalism reallysecond say bentham fails take account changing
character people hence changing character good
criticism especially important marxbelieved important statement contingent upon particular
historical condition marx argues human nature dynamicconcept single utility human onedimensionaluseful decries bentham application yard measurepast present future decries implicationsociety people always alwayscriticizes essentialism seeimplication conservatively used reinforce institutionregarded reactionary moment religion hapositive consequence say marx doesnt mean viewed historically
isnt regressive institution abolished

marx criticism criticism bentham view similar
view utility utilitarianism utilitarian woulddeny different thing make different people happypromotes happiness change time neither would utilitarian deny
importance investigation promotes utility

marx criticism applies analytical philosophy philosophy
doe take explicit account movement history
dialectic right thing changenecessary take account making practical
judgement doesnt mean isnt useful theory
give mean evaluate change
also utilitarianism originally developed moderate challenge
status quo demand everyone count one one
wa anathema elitist society victorian britain

utilitarian criticism schools

one criticism many school cannot even theory solve
real world complex ethical problem various inviolable principles
collide like triage atomic bombing hiroshimanagasaki right decision

criticism kantianism leveled hare could kantutilitarian argued number different ethical
position could fit kant description categorical
