word organism usually describes independent collectionsystem example circulatory system digestive system reproductive
system collection organ turn
collection tissue made cell concept

organism say stomach independent complex
interdependent relationship separate whole organism grouporganism population virus bacteria withoutorgan stable function would transform cease organ within

indirectly ecosystem thus boundary organismnearly always disputable living matter exists within larger
heterarchical system life made wide variety transient

viruses

virus typically considered organismcapable independent reproduction metabolism controversy
problematic though since parasite endosymbiontsincapable independent life either although virus enzymes
molecule characteristic living organism incapablesurviving outside host cell metabolic processes
require host genetic machinery

concept superorganism dispute many biologists
maintain order social unit considered organism
individual permanent physical connection
evolution governed selectionwhole society instead individual generally accepted
society eusocial animal unit natural selectionleast extent evolutionist claim individualstill primary unit selection

question remains considered individual
darwinian like richard dawkins suggest individual selectedtheselfish gene others believe whole genomeorganism wilson shown antcolonies social
insect breeding entity colony selectedindividual member could apply bacterial members
stromatolite genetic sharing way
comprise single gene pool gaian theorist like lynn margulis would
argue applies equally symbiogenesis bacterial
