construction map projection

creation map projection involves three steps
selection model shape earth planetary body
usually choosing sphere ellipsoid
transformation geographic coordinateslongitude latitude
plane coordinate eastings northings reduction scale doe matter order second
third step performed

real earth shape irregular information lostfirst step approximating regular model chosen
reducing scale may considered part transforming
geographic coordinate plane coordinates

map projection practically theoreticallyprojection physical sense rather dependmathematical formula direct physical interpretation
however understanding concept map projection helpful
think globe light source placed definite point
respect projecting feature globe onto surface
following discussion developable surface basedconcept

choosing projection surface

scale

globe way represent earth scale
throughout entire map surface direction flat map
even possible across area extent

thus flat map property constant scale always limited

possible propertyscale depends location directionequivalent preservation angle conformal map
given latitude direction scaleeverywhere applies cylindrical projection
combination two scale depends latitudelongitude direction applies mercator projection

choosing model shape earth

projection construction also affected shape earth
approximated following discussion projection categories
sphere assumed however earth exactly sphericalcloser shape oblate ellipsoid shape bulge aroundequator selecting model shape earth involves choosing
advantage disadvantage sphere versusellipsoid spherical model useful smallscale mapworld atlas globe since error scale usually
noticeable important enough justify using complicated
ellipsoid ellipsoidal model commonly used construct
