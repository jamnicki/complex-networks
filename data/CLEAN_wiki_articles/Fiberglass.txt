properties

glass fiber useful high ratio surface areaweight however increased surface make much susceptible
chemical attack

trapping air within block glass fibre make good thermal
insulation thermal conductivity ofwmk

glass strength usually tested reported virgin fibers

le resulting tenacity glass amorphous
structure property along fiber acrossfibre humidity important factor tensile strength
moisture easily adsorbed worsen microscopic cracksurface defect lessen tenacity

contrast carbon fibre glass undergo elongationbreaks

viscosity molten glass important manufacturing

circumference viscosity relatively lowhigh fiber break drawing however lowglass form droplet rather drawing fibre

manufacturing processes

two main type glass fiber manufacture two main types
glass fiber product first fibre made either direct melt
process marble remelt process start raw materials
