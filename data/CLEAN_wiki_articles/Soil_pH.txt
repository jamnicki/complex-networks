balance phthe soil said neutral scale
cover continuum ranging fromvery acidic tovery alkalinebasic however uncommon find soil either extremerange many condition soil tend become acid alkaline
time step taken maintain balance

note alkaline basic interchangeable however asideuncommon example ammonia testing alkaline testing bring similar result higher alkalinity greatertendency towards base

soil important consideration farmer gardenerseveral reason including fact many plant soil life
form prefer either alkaline acidic condition diseases

acidification process decrease resultrelease positively charged ion cation cation exchange

much difficult issue soil solution concentrationterm plant available nutrient usually include pool soil

eg cation exchange one reason including poolplant capability releasing organic acid increasetotal soil solution concentration cation nutrientimportant plant

thus important realise exists simple relation
soil solution concentration mg reasonable

weatherable mineral tends higher higher soil
solution concentration mg hand depositionsulphate nitrate extent ammonia decrease soil
solution essentially without affecting mg concentrations
whereas deposition seasalt increase mg concentrations
without much effect soil solution 
interpreting soil solution value essential takeaccount method ha measured depending whether
water equilibrated ambient pressureph reported site may either high lowsimply carbon dioxide pressure deep soil

result carbonic acid hence lower furthermore soil

soil life 
ph level aroundis also optimum range preferredsoil bacteria although fungi mold anaerobic bacteriabroader tolerance tend multiply lower value therefore
acidic soil tend susceptible souring putrefaction
rather undergoing sweet decay process associaeed decay
organic matter immeasurably benefitting soil also prefernearneutral conditions

ph plant diseases

many plant disease caused exacerbated extreme sometimes make essential nutrient unavailable crops
soil unhealthy see example
chlorosis leaf vegetable potato scab occur overly alkaline
condition acidic soil cause clubroot brassicas

ph constant soil water varies seasonal even
daily basis due factor rainfall biological growth within
soil temperature change rather map levelmosaic varying according soil crumb structure surfacecolloid microsites also exhibit vertical gradients
