history

emds diesel program well underway late early
thanks success company demonstration across
country funits production great moving
train railroad fullwidth carbody made difficult
locomotive crew see rear locomotive funits
also lacked anywhere brakeman switchman stand ride
short distance performing switching duty funitsgrab iron stirrup step feature didnt goodtight clearances

since engine inside locomotive hood didnt take full
carbody width seemed logical hood could cut away
bit allow crew see ride safely wasnt entirely
new idea either pennsylvania railroad fleetfeatured large cutout section hood service since


another problem facing emd alco making inroadmarket emd would liked keep alcos series switcher starting take many task emd
wanted fulfill locomotives

emds designer engineer set work came carbody
reminiscent mechanic contained technical
knowledge learned company funit series starting
f product effort became demonstrator
bl locomotive model name officially stood branch
line indicating emd felt locomotive best suitedlight traffic frequent switching chores

bl differed mechanical detail one wa builtmore bls built sold railroads
primarily eastern midwestern united states

service locomotive intended purpose could easily

limiting locomotive success several mechanical ergonomic
feature mechanical component within engine compartmentdifficult access maintain reducing appeal among railroad
shop crew locomotive carbody lacked fulllength walkwaysubsequent diesel making difficult brakemanswitchman move one point locomotive anotherswitching operation finally although industrial designer emd
tried build carbody evoked highclass passenger trainretaining utilitarianism railroad work visual design never
quite caught however even though didnt succeed well
emds engineer learned quite bit endeavor incorporated
good idea company widely successful series locomotives
