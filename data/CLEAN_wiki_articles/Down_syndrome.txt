possible birth predict capabilityidentification best method teaching particular child
ideally begin soon birth early intervention programs
since child syndrome wide range abilities
success school vary greatly stress importanceevaluating child individually cognitive problem found
among child syndrome also found among typical
child therefore parent use general program offered
school means
