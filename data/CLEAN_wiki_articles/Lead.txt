lead used projectile firearm fishing sinkers
density low cost compared alternative products
ease use due relatively low melting point
lead used candle treat wick ensure longer
even burn danger european north american
manufacturer use expensive alternative zinc
lead used shielding radiation
molten lead used coolant lead cooled fast
