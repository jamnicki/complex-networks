geology

mine first commercial diamond mine except alluvial mining
operation located kimberlite pipe pipe named although commonly simply called argyle pipe

volcanic pipe diatreme composed olivine lamproite present
tuff lava peripheral volcanic facies suggest lamproite
eruption formed maar margin volcanic pipelamproite mixed volcanic breccia containing shattered wall
rock fragment mixed milled eruption mineralmarginal facies include zeolite mineral mica kaolinite clays
typical posteruption hydrothermal circulation

diamond found within intact core volcanic pipe well
within marginal breccia facies maar facies however
diamond considered resorbedposteruption cooling pipe converted graphite

diatreme pipe formed explosive eruption lamproite magma
zone weakness continental crust

diamond found argyle pipe dated 
billion year age volcano created pipe aged
betweenandbillion year old represents relatively
short period diamond formation could taken place
aroundmillion year may explain small average size
unusual physical characteristic argyle diamond diamond found
argyle pipe predominantly eclogitic meaning carbon
organic origin see natural history diamonds

addition pipe number semipermanent
stream eroded away portion pipe created
significant alluvial deposit diamond deposit also
actively mined
