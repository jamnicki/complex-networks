historical background

discovery aberration light inby james bradleyone important astronomy totally unexpectedwa extraordinary perseverance perspicuity bradley
wa able explain inits origin based attempt madediscover whether star possessed appreciable parallaxcopernican theory solar systemthat earth revolved
annually sunhad received confirmation observations
galileo tycho brahe however never accepted
heliocentrism mathematical investigation keplernewton

early asthomas digges suggested theorynecessitate parallactic shifting star consequentlystellar parallax existed copernican theory would
receive additional confirmation many observer claimeddetermined parallax tycho brahe giovanni battista
riccioli concluded existed mindobserver due instrumental personal error 
jean picard voyage uranibourg stated result ten

transited close zenith course two years
