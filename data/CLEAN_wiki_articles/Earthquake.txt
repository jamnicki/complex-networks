naturally occurring earthquakes

naturally occurring earthquake related tectonic nature
earth earthquake called tectonic earthquakeearth lithosphere patchwork plate slow constant
motion caused heat earth mantle core plate
boundary grind past creating frictional stressfrictional stress exceeds critical value called local strengthsudden failure occurs boundary tectonic plate alongfailure occurs called fault plane failure fault
plane result violent displacement earth crustelastic strain energy released seismic wave radiated thus
causing earthquake process strain stress failurereferred elasticrebound theory estimated 
percent earthquake total energy radiated seismic
energy earthquake energy used power earthquake
fracture growth converted heat therefore earthquakes
lower earth available potential energy though lossnegligible

earthquakes

majority tectonic earthquake originate depth exceeding
ten kilometer subduction zone older colder

occur much greater depth hundred kilometerseismically active area subduction known wadatibenioff

measuring earthquakes

since seismologist cannot directly observe rupture earths
interior rely geodetic measurement numerical experiments
analyze seismic wave accurately ass severity earthquakes
severity earthquake measured term magnitudeintensity seismologist use two fundamentally differentequally important type scale original force energyearthquake measured magnitude scale richter scalewell known example magnitude scale second type scale
measure intensity shaking occurring given pointearth surface scale referred intensity scalemercalli intensity scale measure effect seismic
wave example commonly used intensity scale

nonspecialized medium often refer magnitudeearthquake reported richter scale howevermagnitude reported nowadays actually moment magnitude
scale older richter scale wellsuitedaccurately measure earthquake magnitude 

analysis earthquake severity allow scientist estimatelocation likelihood future earthquake helping identify areas
