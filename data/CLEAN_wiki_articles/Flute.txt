flute acoustics

flute produce sound stream air directed across holeinstrument bounce holesome engineercalled fluidic multivibrator functionally
analogous electrical device electronic circuit calledmultivibrator

air stream across hole creates bernoulli siphon effect
leading von karman vortex street excites air contained
usually cylindrical resonant cavity within flute player
