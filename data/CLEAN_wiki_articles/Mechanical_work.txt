formula readily explains nonzero force zero worksimplest case force always perpendiculardirection motion making integrand always zero viz circular
motion however even integrand sometimes take nonzero values
still integrate zero sometimes negativesometimes positive

doe work transfer nonzero impulse

units

si derived unit work joule definedwork done force one newton acting distance one meter

equivalent newtonmeter sometimes used instead howeveralso sometimes reserved torque distinguish unit work
