symptoms

atoday incubation period typical symptom arise
fever muscle ache headache backache symptom may
include red tongue flushed face reddening eyeportion case also involvement internal organ including
liver kidney heart may hemorrhagegastrointestinal tract causing bloody vomit black colour
called coffee ground vomiting explains name black vomit
later disease sometimes complicated jaundice liver
failure cause yellow skin colour hence name yellow
fever andor kidney insufficiency proteinuria disease
progress delirium seizure coma ensue hypotensiondehydration also common

pathogenesis

yellow fever infection frequently severe moderate cases
may occur result previous infection another flavivirus
infection virus first replicates locally followedtransportation rest body via lymphatic system
following systemic lymphatic infection virus proceeds establish
throughout organ system including heart kidney adrenal
gland parenchyma liver high viral load also
present blood necrotic massescouncilman body appearcytoplasm hepatocytes
