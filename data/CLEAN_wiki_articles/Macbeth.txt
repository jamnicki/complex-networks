scottish play

many today would simply chalk coincidence actortheatre people often consider bad luck mention macbethname inside theatre usually refer superstitiouslyscottish play sometimes scottish king

said shakespeare used spell real witches
text witch got angry said cursed play
thus say name play inside theatre believed doom
production failure perhaps cause physical injury worse
cast member large mythology built surroundingsuperstition countless story accident misfortune even
death mysteriously taking place run macbeth

alternative explanation superstition struggling
theatre company would often put popular blockbustereffort save flagging fortune however tall order
single production reverse longrunning trend poor
business therefore last play performed theatre shutwa often macbeth thus growth idea waunlucky play

superstition parodied blackadder third episode
