modern archaeological project often begin survey regional
survey attempt systematically locate previously unknown sites

survey widely practiced early day archaeology
cultural historian prior researcher usually contentdiscovering location monumental site local populace
excavating plainly visible feature gordon willey
pioneered technique regional settlement pattern survey 
viru valley coastal peru survey level became
prominent rise processual archaeology year later

survey work many benefit performed preliminary exercise
even place excavation requires relatively little time
expense doe require processing large volumesoil search artifact nevertheless surveying large region
site expensive archaeologist often employ sampling
method avoids ethical issue particular concern descendant
people associated destroying site excavationway gather form information settlement
pattern settlement structure survey data commonly assembled
map may show surface feature andor artifact
distribution

simplest survey technique surface survey involves combingarea usually foot sometimes use mechanised
transport search feature artifact visible surface
surface survey cannot detect site feature completely
buried earth overgrown vegetation surface survey may
also include miniexcavation technique auger corershovel test pits

aerial survey conducted using camera attached aircraft
balloon even kite birdseye view useful quick mapping
large complex site ariel photograph used documentstatus archaeological dig aerial imaging also detect many
thing visible surface plant growing buried man
made structure stone wall develop slowlytype feature midden may developrapidly photograph ripening grain change colour rapidlymaturation revealed buried structure great precision
aerial photograph taken different time day help showoutline structure change shadow aerial survey also
