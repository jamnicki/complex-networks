epidemiology

trichinosis known early asto causedparasite mechanism infection unclear timewa decade later american scientist joseph leidy
pinpointed undercooked meat primary vector parasitetwo decade afterwards hypothesis fully
accepted scientific community 

infection common quite rare developed
world fromtoan annual average ofcases per yearreported united state number case decreased
legislation prohibiting feeding raw meat garbagehog increased commercial home freezing pork public
awareness danger eating raw undercooked pork products
today one primary cause trichinosis americaconsumption raw undercooked wild game meats

developing world infection associatedundercooked pork example thailand betweenandcases
reported annually around thai new year part eastern
europe report swine herd trichinosis
infection rate aboveand correspondingly large numbers

prevention

cooking meat product juice run clear internal
temperature offc
freezing pork thaninches thick fordays atfc
three day atfc kill larval worms
cooking wild game meat thoroughly freezing wild game meat unlike
freezing pork product even long period time mayeffectively kill worm specietrichinella typically infects wild game resistantfreezing specie infects pigs
cooking meat fed pig wild animals
allowing hog eat uncooked carcass animals
including rat may infected trichinosis
cleaning meat grinder thoroughly preparing ground meats
public control destruction pork meat trichins control pig diaphragma allowing soldpublic

curing salting drying smoking microwaving meat doeconsistently kill infective worms
