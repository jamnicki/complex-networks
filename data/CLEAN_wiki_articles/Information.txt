word wikipedia binary form commonly usedstoring computer information

information result processing manipulating organizing
data way add knowledge person receiving
information concept bear diversity meaning everyday
usage technical setting generally speaking conceptinformation closely related notion constraint communication
control data form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus
pattern perception representation

many people speak information age adventknowledge age knowledge society information societyinformation technology even though informatics information
science computer science often spotlight word
information often used without careful considerationvarious meaning acquired

information message

information state system interest curiosity message
information materialized

information quality message sender onereceiver information always something size parameter
occurrence eventviewed manner informationaccurate may truth lie sound
kiss even disruptive noise used inhibit flowcommunication create misunderstanding would view form
information however generally speaking amountinformation received message increase accuratemessage

existence definite sender information message
model doe attach significance idea informationsomething extracted environment egobservation reading measurement

even though information data often used interchangeablyactually different data set unrelated information
use properly evaluated upon

measuring information entropy

view information message came prominencepublication inof influential paper claude shannona
mathematical theory communication paper providesfoundation information theory endows word informationtechnical meaning also measure sending device
equally likely send one set messagepreferred measure information produced one messagechosen set base two logarithm measurecalled selfinformation paper shannon continues

choice logarithmic base corresponds choiceunit measuring information baseis usedresulting unit may called binary digit briefly
bit word suggested w tukey device two stable
position relay flipflop circuit store one
bit information device store bit bell

complementary way measuring information provided algorithmic
information theory brief measure information contentlist symbol based predictablespecifically easy generate list sequencewould low algorithmic information measurement sincepredictable pattern pattern continues measurement
would change shannon information would give information
measurement symbol since statistically randomnew symbol would increase measurement

information pattern

information represented pattern view assumes neither
accuracy directly communicating party instead assumesseparation object representation wellinvolvement someone capable understanding relationshipview seems therefore require conscious mind considerfollowing example economic statistic represent economy however
inaccurately commonly referred data computing
statistic field form information sense
electromagnetic pattern computer network connected
device related something patterntext displayed keyboard input signal sign symbols
also category hand according semiotics
data symbol certain syntax information datacertain semantic painting drawing contain informationextent represent something assortment objects
table profile landscape word pattern
something transposed pattern something else latter
information type information still assumes involvement
conscious mind either entity constructingrepresentation entity interpreting
accept information defined merely patternfollow neither utility meaning necessary components
information surely distinction must made raw
unprocessed data information posse utility valuequantum meaning information may indeed characterisedpattern necessary condition sufficient exampletelephone book follows specific pattern name address telephone
number

individual entry doe become informative sense unless
posse degree utility value meaningexample someone might look girlfriend number might ordertake away etc vast majority number never construedinformation meaningful sense gap datainformation closed behavioural bridge whereby value
utility meaning added transform mere data patterninformation

one construct representation object one selectively
extract objectsampling use system sign replace
encoding sampling encoding resultrepresentation example former sample productexample latter verbal description productcontain information product however inaccurate one
interprets representation one predict broader patternlimited number observation inference understand relation
pattern two different thingsdecoding one exampleformer sip soup know spoiled examplelatter examining footprint determine animalcondition case information source constructedpresented sender information repeat informationsense doe assume direct communication assumes
involvement conscious mind

regardless information dependent upon usually unrelatedseparate medium medium used express words
position theoretical series bit even outputinterpreted computer similar device unimportant except
someone something present interpret information
therefore quantity information totally distinctmedium

information sensory input

often information viewed type input organismdesigned device input two kind input importantfunction organism example food device energybook sensory ecology dusenbery called causal
input input information importantassociated causal input used predict occurrence
causal input later time perhaps another placeinformation important association information
eventually must connection causal inputpractice information usually carried weak stimulus mustdetected specialized sensory system amplified energy inputs
functional organism device example
light often causal input plant provides informationanimal colored light reflected flower weakmuch photosynthetic work visual system bee detectsbee nervous system information guide beeflower bee often find nectar pollencausal input serving nutritional function

information type sensory input organismnervous system receives input transforms inputelectrical signal regarded information idearepresentation still relevant slightly different manner
abstract painting doe represent anything
concretely viewer see painting nevertheless
transformed electrical signal create representationpainting defined way information doe relatedtruth communication representation object entertainmentgeneral intended informative music performing arts
amusement park work fiction thus forminformation sense form information
according previous definition consider another example
food supply nutrition taste eatinformation equated sensory input nutritioninformation taste
information influence lead transformation

information type pattern influence formationtransformation pattern sense needconscious mind perceive much appreciate pattern
consider example dna sequence nucleotide pattern
influence formation development organism without
need conscious mind system theory time seems refer
information sense assuming information doe necessarily
involve conscious mind pattern circulating due feedback
system called information word said
information sense something potentially perceivedrepresentation though created presented purpose
