perhaps famous misconception belief ilsa says
play sam see quote actual wording

errors

film several logical flaw foremost two letters
transit enable bearer leave vichy french territory
unclear whether ugarte say letter signed vichy
general maxime weygand free french leader general charles gaulle
english subtitle official dvd read gaullefrench one specify weygand listenweygand vichy
delegategeneral north african colony monthfilm set year written gaulle watime head free french government enemy vichy
regime controlling morocco vichy court martial convicted gaulle treason absentia sentenced life imprisonmentaugustthus seems implausible letter signedwould benefit classic macguffin letterinvented joan allison original play never questioned
even within film rick suggests renault letter would
allowed ilsa escape let alone laszlo peopleheld casablanca spite legal rights

also laszlo say nazi cannot arrest still
unoccupied france violation neutrality would reflect captain
renault however make sense could walk around freely
casablanca ebert point would arrested sight

difficulty include airport searchlight pointing cafe
rather sky continuity error station paris
rick wet coat becomes dry get train renaults
claim american blundered berlin
incurtizs attitude toward issue clearhe saidmake fast nobody notices

finally movie depicts flag french morocco incorrect
consisting french tricolour islamic crescent moon star
middleinthe flag french protectorate morocco
wa current moroccan flag civil ensign
consisted common moroccan flag white fimbriated french flag
cantonthe flag used earlier filmfrench foreign legion
