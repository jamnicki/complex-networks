colour

printmaker apply color print many different way often
colour printmaking involves etching screenprinting woodcut

engraving

used goldsmith decorate metalwork using burindifficult skill learn

engraver use hardened steel tool called burin cut design
surface metal traditionally copper plate graver come
variety shape size yield different line typeburin produce unique recognizable quality linecharacterized steady deliberate appearance clean edges
tool mezzotint rocker roulets burnishers used
texturing effects

plate inked ink wiped surface
leaving ink engraved line plate put
highpressure printingpress together sheet paper
often moistened soften paper pick inkengraved line making print process repeated many times
typically several hundred impression copy could printedplate show much sign wear work plate alsoadded repeating whole process creates engraving

mezzotint

intaglio variant engraving plate first roughened
evenly image brought scraping smoothsurface creating image working dark lightpossible create image roughening plate selectively
working light dark

mezzotint known luxurious quality tone first
evenly finely roughened surface hold lot ink
allowing deep solid color printed secondly process
smoothing texture burin burnisher scraper allows fine
gradation tone developed

mezzotint printmaking method invented ludwig von siegen
process especially widely used englandmideighteenth century reproduce portrait paintings

aquatint

variant etching like etching aquatint applicationacid make mark metal plate etching technique
us needle make line print black whatever colour ink
used aquatint powdered resin acid resistantground create tonal effect tonal variation controlledlevel acid exposure large area thus imageshaped large section time

goya used aquatint prints

drypoint

variant engraving done sharp point rather vshaped
burin engraved line smooth hardedged drypoint
scratching leaf rough burr edge line burr
give drypoint print characteristically soft sometimes blurry
line quality pressure printing quickly destroysburr drypoint useful small edition tentwenty impression counter allow longer print runs

year age due exposure soaking various acidliquid inhaling rosin aquatinting

whereas past printmaker used put plateacid bath bare hand nowadays printmaker use industrial
