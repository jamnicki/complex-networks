discovery

inthe discovery planetarymass companion star 
cygni wa announced mass leasttimes jupiter
time highest orbital eccentricity known
extrasolar planet discovery made measuring stars
radial velocity like planet discovered using methodlower limit mass known

orbit mass

unlike planet solar system planet orbit highly
elliptical distance varies fromau periastron 
au apastron high eccentricity may caused tidal
interaction binary star system planet orbit may vary
chaotically low higheccentricity state periodten million years

lower limit object mass well dividing line
planet brown dwarf atjupiter mass preliminary
astrometric measurement however suggest orbit ofcygni may
highly inclined respect line sight around 
would mean object mass may aroundtimesjupiter making lowmass brown dwarf

characteristics

since planet detected indirectly measurementparent star property radius compositiontemperature unknown

planet highly eccentric orbit mean planet would experience
extreme seasonal effect despite simulation suggestearthlike moon would able support liquid water surface
course year though unclear whether moons
could actually form
