morning augustwhen united state droppeduranium guntype device codenamedlittle boy japanese city
hiroshima second event occurred three day laterunited state dropped plutonium implosiontype device codenamed 
fat man city nagasaki use weaponresulted immediate death aroundtopeople
even time remains controversialcritics around
world charged unnecessary act mass killing
others claimed ultimately reduced casualtyside hastening end war topic seen increased

critic idea nuclear strategy waging

power would result mutual annihilation point view
significance nuclear weapon purely deter warnuclear war would immediately escalate mutual distrust fear
resulting mutual assured destruction threat nationalglobal destruction strong motivation antinuclear
weapon activism
