history light aether

isaac newton assumed light made numerous small
particle order explain feature ability travel
straight line reflect surface theory knownproblem although explained reflection wellexplanation refraction diffraction le pleasing order
explain refraction fact newton optickspostulatedaethereal medium transmitting vibration faster lightlight overtaken put fit easy reflexion easy
transmission causing refraction diffraction newton believed
vibration related thing like heat radiation
saying

heat warm room conveyd vacuumvibration much subtiler medium airair drawn remained vacuummedium medium light refractedreflected whose vibration light communicates heatbody put fit easy reflexion easy
transmission

modern understanding course heat radiation light
newton considered two different phenomenon believing heat
vibration excited ray light fall upon surfacepellucid body wrote know aetherconsists particle must exceedingly
smaller air even light exceeding
smallness particle may contribute greatness force
particle may recede one another thereby make
medium exceedingly rare elastick airconsequence exceedingly able resist motion projectiles

christiaan huygens prior newton hypothesized lightwa wave propagating aether newton rejectedidea main reason rejection stemmed factmen could apparently envision light longitudinal wave
like sound mechanical wave gas fluid however
longitudinal wave necessity one form given
propagation direction rather two polarization transverse
wave thus unable explain phenomenonbirefringence two polarization light refracted
differently crystal instead newton preferred imagine
nonspherical particle corpuscle light different
side give rise birefringence reason newton
rejected light wave medium however medium
would extend everywhere space would thereby disturb
retard motion great body planet comets
thus light medium use hindersoperation nature make languish evidence
existence therefore ought rejected

injames bradley carried series experiment attemptingmeasure stellar parallax although failed detect parallax
thereby placing lower limit distance star discovered
another effect stellar aberration effect dependsposition parallax speed noticed apparent
position star changed earth moved around orbit
bradley explained effect context newton corpuscular
theory light showing aberration angle givensimple vector addition earth orbital velocity velocity
corpuscle light vertically falling raindrop strike
moving object angle knowing earth velocityaberration angle enabled estimate speed lightexplain stellar aberration context etherbased theorylight regarded problematic requiresether stationary even earth move itpreciselyproblem led newton reject wave model first place

however century later young fresnel revived wave theorylight pointed light could transverse wave
rather longitudinal wavethe polarization transverse wave
like newton side light could explain birefringencewake series experiment diffraction particle model
newton finally abandoned physicist still assumed however
like mechanical wave light wave required mediumpropagation thus required huygens idea aether gas
permeating space

however transverse wave apparently required propagating mediumbehave solid opposed gas fluid idea solid
interact matter seemed bit oddaugustinlouis cauchy suggested perhaps sortdragging entrainment made aberration measurements
difficult understand also suggested absencelongitudinal wave suggested aether negative
compressibility george green pointed fluid would
unstable george gabriel stokes became champion entrainment
interpretation developing model aether mightanalogy pine pitch rigid high frequency fluidlower speed thus earth could move fairly freelywould rigid enough support light

later maxwell equation showed light electromagnetic
wave maxwell equation required electromagnetic wavevacuum propagate fixed speed occur one

based wheel gear george fitzgerald even constructedworking model one model nontrivial especially

contemporary scientist aware problem aether theory

early century aether theory trouble seriesincreasingly complex experiment carried latetry detect motion earth aether failed

aether classical mechanics

key difficulty aether hypothesis arosejuxtaposition two wellestablished theory newtonian
dynamic maxwell electromagnetism galilean
transformation equation newtonian dynamic invariant
whereas electromagnetism basically meanphysic remain nonaccelerated experiments
light would follow rule travellinguniversal aether frame effect caused differencedetectable

simple example concern model aether originally
built sound speed propagation mechanical wave speed
sound defined mechanical property mediuminstance one airliner still carryconversation person beside sound words
travelling along air inside aircraft effectbasic newtonian dynamic say everything sound
trajectory thrown baseball remainaircraft sitting still earth basisgalilean transformation concept frame reference

wa true light since maxwell mathematics
demanded single universal speed propagation light based
local condition two measured property assumed
throughout universe number change
noticeable effect sky star different
direction would different color instance certainlywould remain constant within small volume inside aircraftexample instance implies light would follow along
aircraft earth fashion similar soundcould light change medium instance using atmospherenear earth already demonstratedsky would colored different direction light moved
still medium aether moving medium earths
atmosphere causing diffraction

thus point one special coordinate systemrest relative aether maxwell noted latedetecting motion relative aether easy enoughlight
travelling along motion earth would different
speed light travelling backward would moving
unmoving aether even aether overall
universal flow change position daynight cyclespan season allow drift detected

experiments

numerous experiment carried late testaether wind effect open dispute due low
accuracy measurement speed propagation inaccurate
comparing two speed look difference essentially
impossible

famous michelsonmorley experiment instead compared source

increasingly sophisticated apparatus returned null result
well conceptually different experiment also attempteddetect motion aether thetroutonnoble experiment

end aether

aether theory dealt another blow galilean transformation
newtonian dynamic modified albert einstein special
theory relativity giving mathematics lorentzian
electrodynamics new nonaether context like major shiftscientific thought move away aether theory happen
immediately experimental evidence built older

einstein lorentz transformation implied radical conceptual

left problem light propagation vacuum
however another paper published month einstein also made
several observation thenthorny problem photoelectric

originally german lecturethe development viewcomposition essence radiation

lorentz side continued use aether conceptlecture aroundhe pointed theoryrelativity say carried independently one

certainly exist also doe energy electrical
oscillation like name aether must
use another word peg hang thing upon concluded
one cannot deny bearer concept certain
substantiality

paul langevin strong supporter special relativity argued
inthat absolute effect velocity change acceleration
radiation demonstrate existence aetheradditional illustration discussed absolute effect velocity
change time dilation two space traveler example would
later lead twin paradox

meantime einstein changed opinion aether concept
lecture meant inauguration university leideneinstein stressed space endowed physical
quantity held general relativity attributed tangible
physical property space including kind medium light
although material one shortly lecture leydenadmitted paper grundgedanken und methoden der
relativittstheorie ihrer entwicklung dargestellt

therefore thought inthat physic one speakether judgement radical though shall see
next consideration general theory relativitymoreover remains allowed assume spacefilling medium
one refer electromagnetic field thus also sure
matter condition thereof

large majority scientist disagreed views

continuing adherents

today majority physicist hold need imagine
medium light propagation exists believe neither
einstein general theory relativity quantum mechanic need

aether unnecessary addition physic violatesprinciple occam razor

moreover hard develop aether theory consistent

nevertheless intuitive appeal causal backgroundrelativistic effect cannot denied physicist holdremain number problem modern physic simplified
