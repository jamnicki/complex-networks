magnesium deficiency human first described medical
literature inthe adult human daily nutritional requirement
affected various factor including sex weight sizemgday inadequate magnesium intake frequently cause muscle
spasm associated cardiovascular disease diabetes
high blood pressure anxiety disorder osteoporosis acute
deficiency see hypomagnesemia rare common drug
side effect chronic alcohol diuretic use low
food intake per incidence chronic deficiency resultingle optimal health debated

dri upper tolerated limit supplemental magnesium ismgday
calculated mg elemental salt supplement basedamino acid chelate glycinate lysinate etc much better tolerated
digestive system side effect older
compound used common symptom excess oral magnesium
intake diarrhea since kidney adult human excrete excess
magnesium efficiently oral magnesium poisoning adult normal
renal function rare infant abilityexcrete excess magnesium even healthy given
magnesium supplement except physician care
