soil evolution cycle

soil represents surface layer earth crust resulting
transformation bare rock enriched organic input

beginning soil formation bare rock outcropgradually colonized pioneer specie lichen mossherbaceous vegetation shrub finally forest parallel first

soil regressive evolution cycle successionregressionsoil follow one another within short interval time human actions
long interval time climate variations

climate role deterioration rock formationsoil lead formulation theory biorhexistasy
wet climate condition favorable deterioration
rock mostly chemically development vegetation
formation soil period favorable life called
biostasy
dry climate rock exposed mostly subjectedmechanical disintegration produce coarse detrital materials

perturbation balance soil

state balance characterized ecosystem climaxreached tends maintained stable course timevegetation installed ground provides humus ensuresascending circulation matter protects grounderosion playing role barrier example protectionwater wind plant also reduce erosion bindingparticle ground roots

disturbance climax cause retrogression givenopportunity nature make every effort restore damage via
secondary succession secondary succession much faster primary
soil already formed although deteriorated needing
restoration well

however significant destruction vegetation take place
natural origin avalanche human origindisturbance undergone ecosystem important latter
case erosion responsible destruction upper horizons
ground origin phenomenon reversionpioneer condition phenomenon called retrogressionpartial total case nothing remains beside bare rockexample clearing inclined ground subjected violent
rain lead complete destruction soil man deeply
modify evolution soil direct brutal actionclearing abusive cut forest pasture litter raking climax
vegetation gradually replaced soil modified example
replacement leafy tree forest moor pine plantations
retrogression often related old human practices

influence human activity

erosion main factor soil degradation due several
mechanism water erosion wind erosion chemical degradationphysical degradation

erosion strongly related human activity example roadincrease impermeable surface lead streaming ground loss
agriculture also accelerates soil erosion increase field size
correlated hedge ditch removal meadow regressionprofit plowed land spring culture sunflower corn beet
surface increasing leave ground naked winter sloping
ground gradually colonized vine lastly use herbicides
leaf ground naked crop new cultural practicemechanization also increase risk erosion fertilizationmineral manure rather organic manure gradually destructuresoil many scientist observed gradual decrease soil organic
matter content soil well decrease soil biological
activity particular relation chemical lastly
deforestation particular responsible degradation forest
soils

agriculture increase risk erosion disturbancevegetation wayovergrazing animals
planting monoculture
row cropping
tilling plowing
crop removal
landuse conversion
