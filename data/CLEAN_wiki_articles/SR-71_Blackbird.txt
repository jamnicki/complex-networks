early year blackbird program analog air inlet
computer would always keep rapidly changing flight
environmental input internal pressure became greatspike incorrectly positioned shockwave would suddenly blowfront inlet called inlet unstart immediately air
flow engine compressor would cease thrust droppedexhaust gas temperature would begin rise due tremendous
thrust remaining engine pushing aircraft asymmetrically
along sudden deceleration caused losingof available
power unstart would cause aircraft yaw violently one
side autopilot manual control input would fight yawing
often extreme angle would reduce airflow opposite
engine cause begin sympathetic stall result wouldrapid counter yawing often loud banging noise rough ride
pilot rsos occasionally experienced pressure suit helmets
banging cockpit canopy initial unstart motions
subsided

one standard counter inlet unstart pilotreach unstart inlet drove spike stopped
yawing condition allowed pilot restart inletrestarted normal engine combustion crew would returnacceleration climb planned cruise altitude

eventually digital air inlet computer replaced original analog
one lockheed engineer developed control software engine
inlet would recapture lost shockwave relight engine
pilot even aware unstart occurred machinist responsible hundred precision adjustments
forward air bypass door within inlet helped control
shock wave prevent unstarts increase performance

fuselage

alignment achieved airframe warmed due air

convinced aerodynamicists try adding windtunnel
model design process chine would supposedly reduce
aircraft radar cross section many angleaerodynamicists discovered chine generated powerful vortices
