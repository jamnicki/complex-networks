photophone

another bell invention photophone device enablingtransmission sound beam light developed together
charles sumner tainter device employed lightsensitive cells
crystalline selenium property electrical
resistance varies inversely illumination resistance
higher material dark lowerlighted basic principle modulate beam light directed
receiver made crystalline selenium telephoneattached modulation done either mean vibrating

metal detector

bell also credited invention metal detector 
device hurriedly put together attempt find bullet
body president james garfield metal detector
worked didnt find bullet metal bedframepresident lying confused instrument bell gave full
account experiment paper read american
association advancement science augustthough
unsuccessful first incarnation achievement would
eventually change nature physical security

hydrofoil

marchscientific american article american hydrofoil
pioneer william meacham explained basic principle hydrofoils
bell considered invention hydroplane significant
achievement based information gained article begansketch concept called hydrofoil boat

bell casey baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation summerpossible aid airplane takeoff water baldwin studied
