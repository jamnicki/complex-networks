ultrasound due costeffectiveness

patient higher suspicion hcc rising
alphafetoprotein level best method diagnosis involves scan abdomen using intravenous contrast agent threephase

ct hcc three distinct pattern growth
single large tumor
multiple tumors
poorly defined tumor infiltrative growth pattern

calcification intralesional fat may appreciated

patient contrast agent allergy poor renal function
mri scan abdomen costly effective substitute

imaged diagnosis confirmed percutaneous biopsyhistopathologic analysis

pathology

macroscopically liver cancer appears nodular infiltrative
tumor nodular type may solitary large mass multipledeveloped complication cirrhosis tumor nodule roundoval grey green tumor produce bile well circumscribed
encapsulated diffuse type poorly circumscribedinfiltrates portal vein hepatic vein rarely

microscopically four architectural cytological types
pattern hepatocellular carcinoma fibrolamellar pseudoglandular
adenoid pleomorphic giant cell clear cell well
differentiated form tumor cell resemble hepatocytes form
trabecula cord nest may contain bile pigment cytoplasm
poorly differentiated form malignant epithelial celldiscohesive pleomorphic anaplastic giant tumor scant
stroma central necrosis poor vascularization
