social differences

although single feature people share
difficulty social behaviour nearly universal oneimportant defining criterion people lack natural
ability see subtexts social interaction may lackability communicate emotional state resultingwellmeaning remark may offend finding hard knowacceptable unwritten rule social behaviour mystify
many termed thehidden curriculum peoplemust learn social skill intellectually ratherintuitively

non autistics able gather information peoples
cognitive emotional state based clue gleanedenvironment people facial expression body language
respect people impaired sometimes
called mindblindness

person may trouble understanding emotionpeople message conveyed facial expression eye
contact body language often missed also mighttrouble showing empathy people thus people might
seen egotistical selfish uncaring caseunfair label affected people neurologically unableunderstand people emotional state usually shocked
upset remorseful told action hurtfulinappropriate clear people lack emotions
concrete nature emotional attachment might ieobject rather people however often seems curiouseven cause concern people shareperspective

failing show affectionor conventional waysdoesnecessarily mean people feel understandinglead partner caregiver feel rejectedunderstanding increased understanding also come learning
comorbid disorder sometimes opposite problem
occurs person unusually affectionate significant
others miss misinterprets signal partner
causing partner stress

speech language differences

people typically highly pedantic way speaking using
far formal register language appropriate context
fiveyearold child condition may regularly speaklanguage could easily come university textbook
especially concerning special area interest

literal interpretation another common universal hallmarkcondition attwood give example girlanswered telephone one day asked paul although

coinage unusual juxtaposition develop rare gift

clinical perspective

research

research seek information symptom aiddiagnostic process research identify cause although
much research still done isolated symptom many studies
exposed base difference area brain structureend currently unknown research ongoing however

peter szatmari suggests promoted diagnosis spark
research syndrome introduced official
classification system inand grown popularitydiagnosis even though validity clearly established
interesting note introduced muchindication status true disorder stimulate
researchits validity much question

research causes

direct cause unknown even though consensus exists
cause widely accepted hereditary
factor suspected multiple gene play part causingsince number severity symptom vary widely among
individual study regarding mirror neuron inferior
parietal cortex revealed difference may underlie certain
cognitive anomaly exhibit understanding action learning imitation simulation
people behaviour nonneurological factor poverty
lack sleep substance abuse mother pregnancy
discrimination trauma early childhood abuse may also
contribute

possible causative mechanism include serotonin dysfunctioncerebellar dysfunction simon baroncohen proposes model autism
based empathisingsystemising theory theory holds
female brain predominantly hardwired empathymale brain predominantly hardwired understandingbuilding system extreme male brain

treatment

treatment coordinate therapy address core symptompoor communication skill obsessive repetitive routinephysical clumsiness highfunctioning autism may considered
together purpose clinical management

typical treatment program generally includes
social skill training teach skill successfully
interact others
cognitive behavioural therapy help better managing emotions
may explosive anxious cut back obsessive
interest repetitive routines
medication coexisting condition depressionanxiety
occupational physical therapy assist sensory
integration problem poor motor coordination
specialized speech therapy help trouble give
take normal conversationparent training support teach parent behavioural
technique use home

many study done early behavioural interventionsingle case one five participant single case
