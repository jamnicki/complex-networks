java javascript

another significant advance technology sun microsystems
java platform initially enabled web server embed small programs
called applet directly information servedapplet would run endusers computer allowing fasterricher user interaction eventually came widely usedtool generating complex serverside content requested
java never gained much acceptance sun hoped platformclientside applet variety reason including lackintegration content applet confined small boxes
within rendered page poor performance particularly startdelay java vms hardware time

javascript however scripting language developed web
page standardised version ecmascript namesimilar java developed netscape sun microsystems
ha almost nothing java exception
like java syntax derived programming
language like java javascript also object oriented like unlike java allows mixed codeboth objectoriented wellprocedural conjunction document object model javascript
ha become much powerful language creator originally
envisioned sometimes usage alongside manipulationdocument object model expressed term dynamic html dhtml
