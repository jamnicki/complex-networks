advantage migration strategy long daynorthern summer breeding bird hour feed young
often abundant food supply particularly insect days
shorten autumn food supply become scarce bird return

downside migration hazard journey especially

evolutionary origin effectively southern specie coming
north breed rather northern specie going south winter

broadwinged long distance migrants

large broadwinged bird rely thermal column rising hot air
enable soar include many bird preyvulture eagle buzzard also storks

migratory specie group great difficulty crossing large
body water since thermal form landbird cannot maintain active flight long distances

mediterranean sea therefore present major obstaclesoaring bird forced cross narrowest pointmean massive number large raptor stork pasarea gibraltar falsterbo bosphorus migration

supply apart seasonal movement northern hemisphere
wintering specie specie broadest sense resident
however many specie undergo movement varying distance depending
rainfall

many tropical region wet dry season monsoon india

australasia

bird migration primarily entirely northernhemisphere
phenomenon southern hemisphere seasonal migration tendsmuch marked several reason
first largely uninterrupted expanse land mass ocean tend
funnel migration narrow obvious pathway makingle obvious human observer second least terrestrial
bird climatic region tend fade one another long
distance rather entirely separate mean rathermake long trip unsuitable habitat reach particular
destination migrant specie usually travel relaxed pace
