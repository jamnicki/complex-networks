weather term encompasses phenomenon atmosphereplanet term normally taken mean activityphenomenon short period time usually days
see also weather report average atmospheric conditionsignificantly longer period known climate usage two
term often overlap physical concept underlyingclosely related

basic mechanism

used without qualification weather understoodweather earth large scale weather result temperature
difference around globe arise mainly area closer
tropic receive energy per unit area sun see also
sunrise sunset region nearer earth pole local
scale temperature difference occur different surfaces
ocean forest ice sheet differing physical
characteristic reflectivity roughness moisture content

surface temperature difference turn cause pressure differencehot surface heat air air expands loweringair pressure resulting horizontal pressure gradient accelerates
air high low pressure creating wind simple systems
thus formed display emergent behaviour produce complex
system thus weather phenomenon large scale example include
hadley cell form atmospheric circulation smaller
scale example would coastal breezes

forecasting

weather forecasting application current technologyscience predict state atmosphere future timegiven location history weather forecasting back millennia
however technique used changed significantly sincetoday weather forecast made collecting much datapossible current state atmosphere particularlytemperature humidity wind using understanding atmospheric
process meteorology determine atmosphere evolves
future however chaotic nature atmosphereincomplete understanding process mean forecast become
le accurate range forecast increases

future

goal scientist control weather experiments
carried many year result usually
ambiguous grander scale science fiction author long
posited idea terraforming planet order makehabitable human may possible distant
future far beyond current technology
