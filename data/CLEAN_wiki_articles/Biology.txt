universality biochemistry cell genetic code

striking example biological universality include lifes

via genetic material using dna rna based genetic codeminor variation across living things

another universal principle organism forms

evolution

central organizing concept biology life common
origin changed developed process evolution
see common descent led striking similarity units
process discussed previous section charles darwin
