magnetic field

uranus magnetic field peculiar since originatinggeometric centre planet tilted almostfrom axis
rotation probably generated motion relatively shallow
depth within uranus neptune similarly displaced magnetic field
suggests magnetic field necessarily consequenceuranus axial tilt magnetotail twisted planet rotation
