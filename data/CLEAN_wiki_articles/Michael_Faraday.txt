chemistry

faraday earliest chemical work assistant davy madespecial study chlorine discovered two new chloride carbon
also made first rough experiment diffusion gasphenomenon first pointed john dalton physical importancewa fully brought light thomas graham joseph
loschmidt succeeded liquefying several gas investigated
alloy steel produced several new kind glass intended
optical purpose specimen one heavy glasses
afterwards became historically important substancefaraday detected rotation plane polarisation light
glass placed magnetic field alsosubstance first repelled pole magnet also
endeavoured success make general methodchemistry distinguished result subject special
study popular exposition

invented earliest form become bunsen burner
used almost universally science laboratoryconvenient source heat

faraday worked extensively field chemistry discovering
chemical substance benzene called bicarburethydrogen inventing system oxidation number liquefying
gas chlorine prepared first clathrate hydrate
faraday also discovered law electrolysis popularized
terminology anode cathode electrode ion term largely
created william whewell accomplishment many modern
chemist regard faraday one finest experimental scientisthistory

electricity

greatest work electricity first experimentrecorded construction voltaic pile seven halfpence
piece stacked together seven disk sheet zinc six pieces

rotation continuous circular motion circular magnetic force
around wire wire extending pool mercury magnet

chemical battery latter device known homopolar
motor experiment invention form foundation modern
electromagnetic technology unwisely faraday published results
without acknowledging debt wollaston davy resulting
controversy caused faraday withdraw electromagnetic research

electric field relation mathematically modelledfaraday law subsequently went become one four
maxwell equation turn evolved generalization
known today field theory

faraday later used principle construct electric dynamoancestor modern power generators

inhe completed series experiment aimed investigatingfundamental nature electricity faraday used static used
battery used animal electricity produce electrostatic
attraction electrolysis magnetism etc concluded contrary
scientific opinion time division various
kind electricity illusory faraday instead proposedsingle electricity exists changing value quantity

near end career faraday proposed electromagnetic forces

despite excellence experimentalist mathematical ability
extend far trigonometry simplest algebra
however experimental work consolidated able james clerk
maxwell developed equation lie basemodern theory electromagnetic phenomenon faraday nevertheless
possessed gift ability present idea clearsimple language
