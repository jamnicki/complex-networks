logic

axiomatization mathematics model euclid elements
reached new level rigor breadth end century particularly arithmetic thanks richard dedekindgiuseppe peano geometry thanks david hilbertbeginning twentieth century set theory new branchmathematics invented georg cantor thrown crisisbertrand russell discovery famous paradox set

quantum mechanics

international congress mathematician ofdavid hilbert
presented famous list twentythree problem considered central
development mathematics new century sixthwa axiomatization physical theory among new
physical theory century one yet receive
treatment end quantum mechanic found condition foundational crisis similarset theory beginning century facing problemphilosophical technical nature one hand apparent
nondeterminism reduced albert einstein believedmust order satisfactory complete explanationdeterministic form still existed two independent
equivalent heuristic formulation socalled matrix mechanical
formulation due werner heisenberg wave mechanical
formulation due erwin schrdinger yet single
unified satisfactory theoretical formulation

completed axiomatization set theory von neumann
began confront axiomatization immediately realizedquantum system could considered pointsocalled hilbert space analogous dimension number
particlesgeneral coordinate andcanonical momentumphase space classical mechanic infinitely many dimensions
corresponding infinitely many possible state system
instead traditional physical quantity positionmomentum could therefore represented particular linear operators
operating space physic quantum mechanic thereby
reduced mathematics linear hermitian operator hilbert
space example famous indeterminacy principle heisenberg
according determination position particle
prevents determination momentum vice versatranslated noncommutativity two corresponding
operator new mathematical formulation included special cases
formulation heisenberg schrdinger culminatedtheclassic mathematical foundation quantum mechanics
however physicist generally ended preferring another approachvon neumann considered elegant satisfactorymathematician approach formulated inby paul diracwa based upon strange type function socalled dirac delta
function harshly criticized von neumann

case von neumann abstract treatment permitted alsoconfront foundational issue determinism nondeterminismbook demonstrated theorem according quantum
mechanic could possibly derived statistical approximation
deterministic theory type used classical mechanics
demonstration contained conceptual error helpedinaugurate line research work john stuart
bell inon bell theorem experiment alain aspectdemonstrated quantum physic requires notion reality
substantially different classical physics

complementary work ofvon neumann proved along garrett
birkhoff quantum mechanic also requires logic substantially
different classical one example light photon cannot
pas two successive filter polarized perpendicularly

third filter added two photons

economics

economics involved great deal mathematicsnumber almost either superficial irrelevant
wa used part provide uselessly precise
formulation solution problem intrinsically vague
economics found state similar physicth century still waiting development appropriate
language express resolve problem physics
found language infinitesimal calculus von neumann
proposed language game theory general equilibrium theory
economics

first significant contribution minimax theorem 
theorem establishes certain zero sum game involving
perfect information player know priori strategyopponent well consequence exists one
strategy allows player minimize maximum losses
hence name minimax examining every possible strategyplayer must consider possible response players
adversary maximum loss player play strategy
result minimization maximum lossstrategy minimizes maximum loss called optimalplayer case minimaxes equal absolute valuecontrary sign common value zero game becomes
pointless

von neumann eventually improved extended minimax theoreminclude game involving imperfect information gametwo player work culminated theclassic theory games
economic behaviour written oskar morgenstern resulted
public attention new york time front page
story like einstein previously earned
