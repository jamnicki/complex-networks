multiple sclerosis abbreviated also known disseminated
sclerosis chronic inflammatory disease affect central
nervous system cns cause variety symptom including
change sensation visual problem muscle weakness depression
difficulty coordination speech severe fatigue pain
although many patient lead full rewarding life cause
impaired mobility disability severe cases

multiple sclerosis affect neuron cell brain spinal
cord carry information create thought perception allow
brain control body surrounding protectingneuron fatty layer known myelin sheath helps
neuron carry electrical signal cause gradual destructionmyelindemyelination transection neuron axon patches
throughout brain spinal cord name multiple sclerosis
refers multiple scar sclerosis myelin sheathscarring cause symptom vary widely depending upon signals
interrupted thought result attackindividual immune system nervous system therefore
categorized autoimmune disease

multiple sclerosis may take several different form new symptoms
occurring either discrete attack slowly accruing time
attack symptom may resolve completely permanent
neurologic problem often persist although much known cause damage exact cause remains unknown currently doecure though several treatment available may slowappearance new symptom primarily affect adult ageonset typically betweenandyears common women

common symptoms

diagnosis

multiple sclerosis difficult diagnose early stagefact definite diagnosis cannot made evidence
least two anatomically separate demyelinating event occurringleast thirty day apart mcdonald criterion represent international
effort standardize diagnosis using clinical data
laboratory data radiologic data
clinical data alone may sufficient diagnosisindividual suffered two separate episode neurologic
symptom characteristic individual alsoconsistent abnormality physical examination diagnosis made testing since people seek
medical attention one attack testing may hasten
diagnosis allow earlier initiation therapy

diagnosed particular subtype may unclear reason switch
one subtype another time subtypes importantprognosis also therapeutic decision inthe united
state national multiple sclerosis society standardized following
four subtype definitions

relapsingremitting

factor triggering relapse

multiple sclerosis relapse often unpredictable occur
without warning obvious inciting factor attacks
however preceded common trigger general relapse occur
frequently spring summer autumn winter
infection common cold influenza gastroenteritis
increase risk relapse emotional physical stress may also
trigger attack severe illness kind statistically
good evidence either trauma surgery trigger
relapse people participate sportprobably avoid extremely strenuous exertion marathon running
heat transiently increase symptom known uhthoffs
phenomenon people avoid sauna even hot
shower however heat established trigger relapses

pregnancy directly affect susceptibility relapse last
three month pregnancy offer natural protection relapses
however first month delivery riskrelapse increasedpregnancy doe seem influence
longterm disability child born motherincreased risk birth defect problems

many potential trigger examined found influence

pathophysiology

although much known multiple sclerosis cause damagereason multiple sclerosis occurs known

multiple sclerosis cause damage

multiple sclerosis disease body immune system
attack myelin surrounding nerve cell myelin fatty substance
cover axon nerve cell important proper nerve
conduction special subset white blood cell called cells
play key role development normal circumstances
lymphocyte distinguish self nonself however
person cell recognize healthy part central
nervous system foreign attack invading
virus

certain cell trigger inflammatory processencounter myelin stimulating immune cell soluble factors
like cytokine antibody normally tight barrier
blood brain called bloodbrain barrier builtendothelial cell lining blood vessel wall inflammatory
process triggered cell create leak bloodbrain
barrier leak turn cause number damaging effects
swelling activation macrophage activationcytokine destructive protein matrix
metalloproteinases final result destruction myelin called
demyelination

repair process called remyelination also play important roleremyelination one reason especially early phases
disease symptom tend decrease disappear temporarily
nevertheless nerve damage irreversible loss neuron occur early
often brain able compensate damage
due ability called neuroplasticity symptom developcumulative result multiple lesion brain spinal cord
symptom vary greatly different individuals
depending lesion occur

oligodendrocyte originally formed myelin sheath cannot
completely rebuild destroyed myelin sheath however brainrecruit stem cell migrate unknown regionbrain differentiate mature oligodendrocyte rebuildmyelin sheath new myelin sheath often effectiveoriginal one repeated attack lead successively effective
remyelinations scarlike plaque built around damaged

treatment

known definitive cure multiple sclerosis however
several type therapy proven helpful different therapies
used patient experiencing acute attack patientrelapsingremitting subtype patient progressive
subtypes patient without diagnosisdemyelinating event managing various consequence attack treatment aimed returning function attack
preventing new attack preventing disability

currently relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis fda approved
treatment ofthere six food drug administration
fdaapproved treatment patient relapsingremitting three interferon interferon betaa avonex rebif betab
betaseron europe japan betaferon interferonmedication derived human cytokine help regulate immune
system fourth medication glatiramer acetate copaxone mixture
polypeptide may protect important myelin proteinsubstituting target immune system attack fifth
medication mitoxantrone effective limited cardiac
toxicity finally sixth medication natalizumab marketedtysabri

currently approved treatment progressive
variety though several medicament studieddescribed therapy multiple sclerosis

relapsingremitting symptomatic attack treated patientunited state typically given high dos intravenous
corticosteroid methylprednisolone end attack sooner
leave fewer lasting deficits
