many scholar believe ancient trading empire constant
danger uneconomic trade food staple goodimproperly valued relative luxury good accountingundeveloped result could famine decline population

one theory minoan collapse increasing use iron tools

another possibility lie northwest mainland mycenaean
civilization flourishing many historian believe conquered
minoan relatively easy fashion since walls

protect mycenaeans managed land ashore would
faced little resistance quigley
