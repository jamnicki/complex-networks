anatomy

general anatomy beetle quite uniform though specific organs
appendage may vary greatly appearance functionmany family order beetle body divided three
section head thorax abdomen like insects
beetle segmented organism three major sectionbody may composed several segments
although always readily discernable

beetle generally characterised particularly hard exoskeleton
hard forewingselytra beetle exoskeleton madenumerous plate called sclerite separated thin suturedesign creates armoured defence beetle maintaining
flexibility elytron used flight tend coverhind part body protect second pair wingsalae
elytron must generally raised order move hind flight wings
beetle flight wing crossed vein landingfolded often along vein stored elytronbeetle ability fly lost notably ground
beetle family carabidae true weevil family curculionidae
also desert cavedwelling specie families

eye compound may display remarkable adaptabilitycase whirligig beetle family gyrinidae eyesplit allow view waterline species
also divided eye cerambycidae curculionidaemany beetle eye notched degree beetle
genus also posse ocellus small simple eye usually
situated farther back head vertex

beetle antenna primarily organ smell may also usedphysically feel beetle environment may used

antenna vary greatly form within coleoptera often

antenna filiform geniculate moniliform pectinate serrateimage antennal form see antenna biology

leg multisegmented end two five small segments
called tarsus vaguely comparable foot like manyinsect order beetle bear claw usually one pair endlast tarsal segment leg beetle use legwalking leg may variously modified adapted uses
among aquatic family dytiscidae haliplidae many hydrophilidaeothers leg notably hind pair modified swimming
often bear row long hair aid purpose beetles
fossorial leg widened often spined digging

physiology

thing beetle somewhere eat even
inorganic matter may consumed beetle highly specialised
diet example colorado potato beetle leptinotarsa
decemlineata almost exclusively colonizes plant potato family
solanaceae others generalist eating plant animals
ground beetle family carabidae rove beetle family
staphylinidae among others entirely carnivorous catch
consume arthropod small prey earthwormsnail decaying organic matter primary diet many species
range dung consumed coprophagous species
certain scarab beetle family scarabaeidae dead animals
eaten necrophagous specie carrion beetles
family silphidae

beetle larva several instardevelopmental stage moult many specie larvae
simply increase size successive instar cases
however dramatic change occur among certain beetle familygenus particularly exhibit parasitic lifestyle first
instar planidium highly mobile order search host

host known hypermetamorphosis example includeblister beetle family meloidae rove beetle particularly
genus aleochara

endopterygote insect beetle larva pupate periodtime pupa emerges fully formed sexually mature adult
beetle imago adult extremely variable lifespanweek year depending species

reproduction

notable way caring egg youngemployed leaf roller bite section leaf causingcurl inwards lay egg thus protected inside

predation

beetle larva variety strategy avoideaten example using camouflage avoid spottedpredator include leaf beetle family chysomelidaegreen colouring similar habitat tree leaves
complex camouflage also occurs weevil family
curculionidae various coloured scale hair cause beetle

many specie including lady beetle blister beetle secrete
poisonous substance make unpalatable specie often

away potential predators

large ground beetle tend attack using strong
mandible forcibly persuade predator seek easier prey
