heavy object table pushed finger hard enoughstatic friction cannot generate sufficient force match force
exerted finger object start sliding acrosssurface finger moved constant velocity needs
apply force exactly cancel force kinetic friction
surface table object moveconstant velocity seems naive observerapplication force produce velocity ratheracceleration however velocity constantforce finger kinetic friction cancelwithout friction object would continually accelerateresponse constant force
