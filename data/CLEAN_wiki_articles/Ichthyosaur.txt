ichthyosaur averagedtometers length althoughsmaller specie grew much larger porpoiselike head
long toothed snout built speed like modern tunaichthyosaur appear also deep diver like modern
whale motaniit estimated ichthyosaur could
swim speed tokmhmph similar modern cetaceanwhale dolphin airbreathing alsoviviparous adult fossil even found containing
fetus although reptile descended egglaying
ancestor viviparity unexpected first appearsairbreathing marine creature must either come ashore lay eggs
like turtle sea snake else give birth live youngsurface water like whale dolphin given streamlined
body heavily adapted fast swimming would difficult
ichthyosaur scramble successfully onto land lay eggs
