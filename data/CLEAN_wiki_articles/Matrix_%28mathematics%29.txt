definition notations

horizontal line matrix called row vertical lines
called column matrix row column calledmbyn matrix written n called dimensiondimension matrix always given number row first
number columns

entry matrix lie row jth column
called entry ijth entry writtenaij aij row always noted first column

often write aaijm time define matrixentry matrix aij called aij allimjn however convention index start
