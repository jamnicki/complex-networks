historical legacy

although casket letter accepted inquiry genuine
study handwriting information contained
therein generally held certain proof guiltauthentic inquiry reached conclusion nothing proven
start could predicted conclusion
would satisfy elizabeth james mackay comment onestranger trial legal history ended finding guiltresult accuser went home scotland accused

impossible prove case either way without casket
letter would case mary hindsight
difficult say major party involved
considered truth priority however notable lady
antonia fraser james mackay john guy written
wellrespected biography mary come conclusionforged guy actually examined elizabethan transcripts
letter rather relying upon later printed copy points
letter disjointed also draw attentionfact french version one letter bad uselanguage grammar mary educated woman could read write
