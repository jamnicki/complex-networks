biomass production

speculation add hundred different specie whilst
others speculate could copepod wouldsum many hundred specie exist planet get
impression biomass superbaspecie total nonkrill yield world fishery finfish
shellfish cephalopod plankton aboutmillion tonne per
year whilst estimate antarctic krill production 
million several billion tonne per year
