stem cell properties

defining properties

rigorous definition stem cell requires posse two
properties
selfrenewalthe ability numerous cycle cell
division maintaining undifferentiated state
unlimited potencythe capacity differentiate mature
cell type strict sense make stem cell either
totipotent pluripotent although multipotent andor
unipotent progenitor cell sometimes referred stem cells

property illustrated vitro using methodclonogenic assay progeny single cell characterized
however vitro culture condition alter behaviour cells
making unclear whether cell behave similar mannervivo considerable debate exists whether proposed adult cell
population truly stem cells

potency definitions

potency specifies differentiation potential potentialdifferentiate different cell type stem cell
totipotent stem cell produced fusion eggsperm cell cell produced first divisionfertilized egg also totipotent cell differentiate
embryonic extraembryonic cell types

pluripotent stem cell descendant totipotent celldifferentiate cell derived three germ layers

multipotent stem cell produce cell closely related
family cell hematopoietic stem cell differentiatered blood cell white blood cell platelet etc

unipotent cell produce one cell typeproperty selfrenewal distinguishes nonstem

treatments

medical researcher believe stem cell research potential
change face human disease number current treatments
already exist although majority commonly used
tend experimental costeffective
medical researcher anticipate able use technology derived
stem cell research treat cancer parkinson disease spinal
cord injury muscle damage amongst number diseases
impairment condition however still exists great dealsocial scientific uncertainty surrounding stem cell researchcould possibly overcome public debate future research

stem cell however already used extensively researchscientist see cell therapy first goal research
see investigation stem cell goal worthy
