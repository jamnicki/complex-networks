diet

diet consists mainly small fish occasionally also squid

grasp chew food shoal fish foundanimal work team keep fish close together maximizeharvest also search fish alone often bottom dwelling
specie sometimes employ fish whacking whereby fishstunned sometimes thrown water fluke make
catching eating fish easier
