modular design shenzhou spacecraft

shenzhou spacecraft closely resembles russian soyuz spacecraft
although substantially larger feature powered orbital
module capable autonomous flight similarity surprising
chinese working closely russian sinceand
benefited access complete blueprint fullscale soyuz
spacecraft shenzhou similar soyuz technical reasonsthe
soyuz design maximizes volume given weight howeverbasic design similar shenzhou contains hardware licenseddirectly copied soyuz

like soyuz shenzhou consists three module forward
orbital modulea reentry capsulein middle aft
service modulethis division based principleminimizing amount material returned earth anything
placed orbital service module doe require heat
shielding greatly increase space availablespacecraft without increasing weight much wouldmodule also able withstand reentry thus soyuzshenzhou living area weight apollo

orbital module contains space experiment crewservicedoperated equipment inorbit habitation reentry capsule
contains seating crew portion shenzhou
return earth surface shape reentry capsulecompromise maximizing living space allowingaerodynamic control upon reentry

aft service module contains life support equipment
required functioning shenzhou two pair solar
panel one pair service module pairorbital module total area oversquare metre indicating
average electrical power overkwsoyuz spacecraft havekw

orbital module also equipped propulsioncontrol system allowing autonomous flight future orbital
module could also left behind planned chinese project 
space station additional station module unmanned test
flight launched far orbital module shenzhou left
functioning orbit several day reentry capsules

month launch significantly docking adapter orbital
module based adapter used apollosoyuz test project

history

china first effort human spaceflight started inwithprojected launch date ofalthough china launch unmanned
satellite inand maintained active unmanned program since
attempt cancelled due lack fund political interest

current chinese human spaceflight programme authorized april
projectwith work beginning januarythe
chief designer include faren wang yongzhi first unmanned
flight spacecraft launched novemberafterprojectwas renamed shenzhou name reportedly chosen jiang
zemin series three additional unmanned flight ensuedshenzhou reentry capsule used date arelarger soyuz
reentry capsule expected later craft designed
carry crew four instead soyuzs three

fifth launch shenzhouwas first carry humanyng
lwi occurred atcst utcon october

like similar space program nation shenzhou hasomewhat controversial china questioning whether china
spend money launching people space arguingresource would better directed elsewhere indeed two earlier human
spaceflight program one midscancelled expense

response number justification offeredchinese medium one long term destiny humanity lieexploitation space china left behind
another program catalyze development science
technology china finally argued prestige
resulting capability increase china statureworld octoberfollowing success shenzhou 
chinese medium officially stated cost flight around
million usd gross cost projectin past 
year wasbillion usd radically lower cost similar
space program nations

chinese medium heavily promoted experiment undertakenshenzhou particularly exposing seed including taiwanzero gravity radiation scientist however discountusefulness type experiment many suggestedmainly gain public support spaceflight nation
still predominantly agricultural

western news medium outlet suggested important
military implication china ability put astronaut space
specifically area reconnaissance antisatellite weaponry
however chinese medium downplayed possible military motivations
although shenzhous orbital module staying orbit months
falling back earth disintegrating equippedhighresolution observation camera could used military
intelligence

however experience united statemanned orbiting laboratory soviet union almaz
space station suggests military usefulness human
spaceflight quite limited practically military usspace much effectively performed unmanned satellite thus
shenzhou orbital module could used military
reconnaissance military reason incorporatingsystem manned mission china could use purely unmanned
satellite purposes
