defines great comet

definition great comet could obviously quite subjective
however comet becomes bright enough noticed people
actively looking becomes well known outsideastronomical community may come known great comet

reason comet become great comets

vast majority comet never bright enough seennaked eye generally pas inner solar system unseenanyone except astronomer however occasionally comet may brighten
naked eye visibility even rarely may become bright
brighter brightest star bright comet becomes
depends three main factors

size activity nucleus

cometary nucleus vary size hundred metre acrossle many kilometre across approach sun large
amount gas dust ejected cometary nucleus due solar
heating crucial factor bright comet becomes large
active nucleus many return inner solar
system cometary nucleus become depleted volatile material thus
much bright comet making first passage
solar system

close perihelion approach

brightness simple reflective body varies inverse
square distance sun object distance
sun double brightness quartered however comets
behave differently due ejection large amount volatile
gas also reflect sunlight may also fluorescebrightness varies roughly inverse cube distancesun meaning comet distance sun halvedbecome eight time bright

mean peak brightness comet depends significantlydistance sun comet perihelionorbit lie outside earth orbit comet approaching sunwithinau may chance becoming great comet

close approach earth

comet become spectacular also need pas closeearth comet halley example usually bright passes
inner solar system everyyears 
apparition closest approach earth almost distant
possible comet became visible naked eye definitely
unspectacular

comet fulfilling three criterion certainlyspectacular sometimes comet failing one criterion stillextremely impressive example comet halebopp exceptionally
large active nucleus approach sun closelydespite still became extremely famous well observed
comet equally comet hyakutake rather small comet became
bright passed extremely close earth
