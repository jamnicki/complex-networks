fish anatomy

digestive system

advent jaw allowed fish eat much wider variety food
including plant organism fish food ingestedmouth broken esophagus entersstomach food broken many fishprocessed fingerlike pouch called pyloric cecum pyloric ceca
secrete digestive enzyme absorb nutrient digested food
organ liver pancreas add enzyme various digestive
chemical food move digestive tract intestine
completes process digestion nutrient absorption

respiratory system

fish exchange gas using gill located either side
pharynx gill made threadlike structure called
filament filament contains network capillary allowlarge surface area exchange oxygen carbon dioxide fish
exchange gas pulling oxygenrich water mouthpumping gill filament blood capillaries
flow opposite direction water causing counter current
exchange push oxygenpoor water openingside pharynx fish like shark lampreys
posse multiple gill opening however fish single gill
opening side body opening hidden beneathprotective bony cover called operculum fishlungfish developed adaptation known labyrinth allows
survive oxygenpoor area place body water
constantly dry specie fish posse specialized organs
serve lung tube brings air containing oxygen organ
way fish mouth kind lungfish dependentreceiving oxygen air suffocate allowed
reach surface water

circulatory system

fish closed circulatory system heart pump blood
single loop throughout body blood heartgill gill rest body backheart fish heart consists four part sinus
venosus atrium ventricle bulbus arteriosus despite
consisting four part fish heart still twochambered
heart sinus venosus thinwalled sac collect bloodfish vein allowing flow atriumlarge muscular chamber atrium serf oneway compartmentblood flow ventricle ventricle thickwalled
muscular chamber doe actual pumping heart pumps
blood large tube called bulbus arteriosus front end
bulbus arteriosus connects large blood vessel calledaorta blood flow fish gills

homeothermy

although fish exclusively aquatic coldbloodedexception case fish number different groupevolved capacity live water extended periodtime amphibious fish mudskipper livemove land several day also certain speciefish maintain elevated body temperature varying degrees
endothermic teleost bony fish suborder scombroidei

costly thought provide advantage increased contractile
force muscle higher rate central nervous system processing

excretory system

many aquatic animal fish release nitrogenous
waste ammonia waste diffuse gillsurrounding water others removed kidney excretory
organ filter waste blood kidney help fish control
amount ammonia body saltwater fish tend lose
water osmosis saltwater fish kidney concentrate
waste return much water possible back bodyreverse happens freshwater fish tend gain water
continuously kidney freshwater fish specially adaptedpump large amount dilute urine fish specially
adapted kidney change function allowing movefreshwater saltwater

sensory nervous system

fish welldeveloped nervous system organize around central
brain divided different part anteriorfront end brain olfactory bulb involvedfish sense smell unlike vertebrate cerebrumfish primarily process sense smell ratherresponsible voluntary action optic lobe process
information eye cerebellum coordinate body movements
medulla oblongata control function internal organs
fish posse highly developed sense organ nearly daylight

shark organ detect low level electric currentfish like electric eel produce electricity

muscular system

fish locomotion

fish move contracting paired set muscle either sidebackbone alternately contraction form sshaped curvemove body fish curve reach back fin
backward force created backward force conjunctionfin move fish forward fish fin used likeairplane stabilizer fin also increase surface areatail allowing extra boost speed streamlined bodyfish decrease amount friction move water since
body tissue dense water fish must compensatedifference sink many bony fish internal organ
called swim bladder adjust buoyancy manipulation
gases

reproductive system

egg fish fertilized either externally internally
depending specie female usually lay egg embryos
egg develop hatch outside body kind fishcalled oviparous fish oviparous fish develop obtaining foodyolk egg salmon example oviparous

ovoviviparous fish keep egg inside mother bodyinternal fertilization embryo develops egg young
born alive like mammals

specie fish various shark viviparous
viviparous fish allow embryo stay mother body like
ovoviviparous fish however embryo viviparous fish obtain
needed substance mother body materialegg young viviparous specie also born alive

immune system

instead fish rely region lymphoid tissue withinorgan produce immune cell example erythrocytes
macrophage plasma cell produced anterior kidneypronephros area gut granulocyte mature

spleen important immune organ various lymphocytes
