design principles

bob scheifler jim gettys set early principle xfollows listed scheiflergettys 
add new functionality unless implementor cannot complete
real application withoutimportant decide system decideserve world need rather make system
extensible additional need met upwardly
compatible fashion
thing worse generalizing one examplegeneralizing exampleproblem completely understood probably bestprovide solutiongetpercent desired effect forpercentwork use simpler solution see also worse better
isolate complexity much possible
provide mechanism rather policy particular place user
interface policy client hands

first principle modified design xadd new functionality unless know real applicationrequire ha largely kept principle sincereference implementation developed view extensionimprovement implementation whilst remaining almost entirely
compatible originalprotocol

x window core protocol

communication server client done exchanging packets
network channel connection established client
sends first packet server answer sending backpacket stating acceptance refusal connectionrequest authentication connection accepted
acceptance packet contains data client usesubsequent interaction server

connection established four type packet exchangedclient server channel
request client request information serverrequest perform action
reply server responds request request generate
replies
event server sends event client keyboardmouse input window moved resized exposed
error server sends error packet request invalid
since request queued error packet generated request may
sent immediately

x server provides set basic service client programs
realize complex functionality interacting server

possible placement windowsis root windowcover whole screenandare toplevel windowsandare
subwindows ofthe part window outside parentvisible

usually called window graphical user interfacetoplevel window window system term window also used
window lie within another window subwindowsparent window graphical element button menu icon etc
realized using windows

window created subwindow parent windowmake window arranged tree hierarchyroot hierarchy called root windowautomatically created server toplevel window exactly
direct subwindows root window visibly root windowlarge screen lie behind windows

identifiers

data window font etc stored server client
know identifier objectsintegers use nameinteracting server example client wishes
window created request server create windowgiven identifier server creates window associateidentifier identifier later used clientrequest example string drawn window

identifier unique server clientexample two window identifier even createdtwo different client client access object givenidentifier even object created another client

attribute properties

every window predefined set attribute setproperty stored server accessible client via
appropriate request attribute data windowsize position background colour etc property piece data
attached window contrary attribute propertymeaning level window core protocol clientstore arbitrary data property window

property characterized name type value properties
similar variable imperative programming languageapplication create new property given namegiven type store value property associatedwindow two property name exist two different
window different type values

property mostly used interclient communication example
property named wmname used storing name window
window manager typically read property display namewindow top
property window shown using xprop programparticular xprop root show property root windowinclude resource parameter programs

events

event packet sent server client communicatesomething client may interested happened clientrequest server send event another client usedcommunication client example client requesttext currently selected event sent clientcurrently handling window hold selection

content window may destroyed conditionexample window covered whenever area destroyed
content made visible server generates expose event notify
client part window drawn

event used notify client keyboard mouse inputcreation new window etc

kind event always sent client kind event
sent client previously stated interestclient may interested kind eventexample client may interested keyboardrelated eventmouserelated events

colour modes

way color handled window system sometimes confuse
user historically several different mode supported
modern application use truecolor bit colorbitsred green blue old specialist application may require
different colour mode many commercial specialist application use
pseudocolor

x protocol actually single bit unsigned integerrepresenting single colour graphic operation calledpixelvalue transferring primary color intensity abits
integer used colour component following
representation color exist may supportedspecific device
directcolor pixel value decomposed separate red green
blue subfields subfield index separate colormap
entry colormaps changed
truecolor directcolor except colormap
entry predefined hardware cannot changed
typically red green blue colormaps provides
near linear ramp intensity
grayscale pixel value index single colormap contains
monochrome intensity colormap entry changed
staticgray grayscale except colormap
entry predefined hardware cannot changed
pseudocolorchunky pixel value index single colormapcontains colour intensity colormap entry changed
staticcolor pseudocolor except colormap
entry predefined hardware cannot changed

xlib client libraries

client program communicate server via xlib client
library particular client use library xaw motif
gtk turn use xlib interacting server

interclient communication

x window core protocol provides mechanism communication
client window property event particularclienttoclient message event however doe specifyprotocol interaction protocol instead governedseparate set interclient communication conventions

interclient communication convention manual specifiesprotocol exchange data via selection interactionapplication window manager specification haconsidered difficult confusing consistency application lookfeel communication typically addressed programming given
desktop environment

interclient exchange protocol ice specifies frameworkbuilding protocol interaction client specific
protocol built top particular session
management protocol xsmp protocol based ice mandates
interaction application session manager
program take care storing statusdesktop end interactive session recoveringanother session user started
newer convention included freedesktop specifications
including draganddrop convention xdnd used transferring data
selecting dragging another window embedded
application convention xembed detail applicationrun subwindow another application

selection cut buffer draganddrop

selection cut buffer draganddrop mechanism usedx window system allow user transfer data windowanother selection cut buffer used typically user
selects text data window paste another one
draganddrop used user selects something windowclick selection drag another window

since two window may handled two different applications
data transfer requires two different client connected server interact window core protocol includes typerequest event specific selection exchangetransfer mainly done using general clienttoclient event
sending window property specific selection
transfer

data transferred client different typeusually text also pixmap number list objects
etc

selection draganddrop active mechanism textselected window client handling window must actively
support protocol transferring data application
requesting contrary cut buffer passive mechanism
user selects text content transferred cut
buffer remains even application handling window
terminates window destroyed

window manager

window manager program control general appearancewindow graphical element graphical user interface
difference look window system different installations
mainly due use different window manager different
configuration window manager

window manager take care deciding position windows
placing decorative border around handling icon handling
mouse click outside window background handling certain
keystroke example iconifying window altf pressed
etc

point view server window managerdifferent client initial positiondecorative border around window handled window manager
using following requests
application request server satisfy requestmapping showing subwindows given window sentevent instead
application request changing parent window

window manager first request intercept requestmapping toplevel window child root window whenever
another application request mapping toplevel windowserver doe sends event window manager instead
window manager reparents window create larger
toplevel window called frame window reparent original
window child graphically corresponds placingoriginal window inside frame window space frame window
taken original window used decorative
frame around window border title bar

window manager manages mouse click frame windowallows example move resize window user clicks
drag border title bar

window manager also responsible handling iconrelated visual element graphical user interface iconexist level window core protocol implemented
window manager example whenever window haiconified window manager fvwm unmaps window makingvisible creates window icon name possibly another
window icon image meaning handling icontherefore completely decided window manager window
manager implement icon
session manager

roughly state session state desktopgiven time set window current contentprecisely set application managing windowinformation allow application restore conditionmanaged window required session manager program
save restore state sessions

recognizable effect using session managerpossibility logging interactive session finding
exactly window state loggingwork session manager program store namerunning application logout start login order
state application restored wellneeded restore content window application mustable save state execution upon request session
manager load back start
x window system include default session manager called xsmsession manager developed specific desktop systemexample ksmserver default session manager kde

x display manager

x display manager program show graphical login
prompt window system generally display manager runs
one server local computer accepts incoming
connection server running remote computer local
server started display manager connectspresent user login screen remote server started
independently display manager connectsituation display manager work like graphical telnet serverx server connect display manager start session
program session run computer display
manager input output computer server
run computer front user
