genetics structure

xlinked recessive inheritance

female posse two xchromosomes whereas male one onechromosome since mutation causing disease recessivewoman carrying defect one xchromosomes mayaffected equivalent allele chromosomeexpress produce necessary clotting factor howeverychromosome men gene factor viii genes

since male receives single xchromosome mother son
healthy female silently carrying deficient genechance inheriting gene disease
mother affected haemophilia 
chance haemophiliac contrast female inherit
disease must receive two deficient xchromosomes onemother father must thereforehaemophiliac hence haemophilia far common among males
