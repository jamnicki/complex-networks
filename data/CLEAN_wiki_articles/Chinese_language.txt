chinese speaker think word viewentirely accurate many word multisyllabic composedone composition known cand
closely resembles traditional western definition word
however concept wa historically technical linguistic term
past century average chinese speaker waaware even today chinese speaker think word illustrated following mandarin chinese sentence 
romanized using pinyin

jgung ling z shnme ysi

would probably laser word doe mean even though
jgungis single word speaker tend think constituents

old chinese middle chinese many monosyllabic word duegreater variability possible sound modern chinese varieties
lost many sound distinction leading homonym words

still feature original monosyllabic morpheme root many chinese
morpheme still associated meaning even though manylonger stand alone individual word situation analogous
