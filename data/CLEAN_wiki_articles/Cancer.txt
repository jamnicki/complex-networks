diagnosing cancer

cancer initially recognized either sign symptoms
appear screening neither lead definitive
diagnosis usually requires opinion pathologist

sign symptoms

roughly cancer symptom divided three groups
local symptom unusual lump swellingtumor hemorrhage
bleeding pain andor ulceration compression surrounding
tissue may cause symptom jaundice
symptom metastasis spreading enlarged lymph node coughhemoptysis hepatomegaly enlarged liver bone pain fractureaffected bone neurological symptom although advanced cancer
may cause pain often first symptom
systemic symptom weight loss poor appetite cachexia 
wasting excessive sweatingnight sweat anaemia specific
paraneoplastic phenomenon specific condition dueactive cancer thrombosis hormonal changes

cancer refers class disease unlikelyever singlecure cancersingle treatment infectious diseases

surgery

theory cancer cured entirely removed surgeryalways possible cancer metastasizedsite body prior surgery complete surgical excisionusually impossible

example surgical procedure cancer include mastectomybreast cancer prostatectomy prostate cancer goalsurgery either removal tumor entire
organ single cancer cell invisible naked eyeregrow new tumor process called recurrence reason
pathologist examine surgical specimen determinemargin healthy tissue present thus decreasing chancemicroscopic cancer cell left patient

addition removal primary tumor surgery often necessary
staging determining extent disease whetherha metastasized regional lymph node staging major
determinant prognosis need adjuvant therapy

occasionally surgery necessary control symptom spinal
cord compression bowel obstruction referredpalliative treatment

chemotherapy

chemotherapy treatment cancer drug anticancer drugs
destroy cancer cell interferes cell divisionvarious possible way duplication dnaseparation newly formed chromosome form chemotherapy
target rapidly dividing cell specific cancer
cell hence chemotherapy potential harm healthy tissue
especially tissue high replacement rate intestinal lining cell usually repairchemotherapy

drug work better together alone two drugs
often given time called combination
chemotherapy chemotherapy regimen given combination

treatment leukaemia lymphoma requires usehighdose chemotherapy total body irradiation treatment
ablates bone marrow hence body ability recoverrepopulate blood reason bone marrow peripheral blood
stem cell harvesting carried ablative parttherapy enable rescue treatment givenknown autologous transplantation alternatively bone marrow maytransplanted matched unrelated donor

immunotherapy

contemporary method generating nonspecific immune
response tumour include intravesical bcg immunotherapysuperficial bladder cancer use interferon interleukin

renal cell carcinoma

radiation therapy

radiation therapy also called radiotherapy xray therapyirradiation use ionizing radiation kill cancer cellshrink tumor radiation therapy administered externally via
external beam radiotherapy ebrt internally via brachytherapyeffect radiation therapy localised confined region
treated radiation therapy injures destroys cell area
treated target tissue damaging genetic material
making impossible cell continue grow divide
although radiation damage cancer cell normal cellnormal cell recover effect radiation function
properly goal radiation therapy damage many cancer
cell possible limiting harm nearby healthy tissue hence
given many fraction allowing healthy tissue recover
fractions

radiation therapy may used treat almost every type solid
tumor including cancer brain breast cervix larynx lung
pancreas prostate skin stomach uterus soft tissue sarcomas
radiation also used treat leukemia lymphoma radiation dose
site depends number factor includingradiosensitivity cancer type whether tissueorgan nearby may damaged radiation thus every
form treatment radiation therapy without side effects

hormonal suppression

growth cancer inhibited providing blocking
certain hormone common example hormonesensitive tumor include
certain type breast prostate cancer removing blocking
estrogen testosterone often important additional treatment

symptom control

although control symptom cancer typically thought

determinant quality life cancer patient playimportant role decision whether patient able undergo
treatment although practicing doctor therapeutic
skill control pain nausea vomiting diarrhea hemorrhagecommon problem cancer patient multidisciplinary
specialty palliative care arisen specifically responsesymptom control need group patients

pain medication morphine oxycodone antiemetic drugs
