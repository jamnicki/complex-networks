henry character king best summed pious indecisiveeasilyled course later life became severely mentally
unstable kind generous caredhelp dire financial situation government giving away
land title advisor avoided ostentatious trappings
role preferring simple dress keen readingbooklearning showed inclination whatsoever towards leading

christian keen justice done nameagain
ironic considering widespread corruption collapse laworder occurred henry seems used religionpiety mean escape harsh world bitter rivalrypower struggle surrounded court excessively

henry seems decent man completely unsuitedkingship allowed totally dominatedpowerhungry faction surrounded court later
powerless stop outbreak bloody civil war clearlymuch cope recurring mental illness
