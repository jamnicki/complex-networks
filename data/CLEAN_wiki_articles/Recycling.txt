recycling reprocessing material new product recycling
prevents useful material resource wasted reducesconsumption raw material reduces energy usage hence
greenhouse gas emission compared virgin production recyclingkey concept modern waste management third componentwaste hierarchy

recyclable material also called recyclables recyclates may
originate wide range source including home industry
include glass paper aluminium asphalt iron textileplastic biodegradable waste food waste garden wastealso recyclable assistance microorganismcomposting anaerobic digestion

recyclates need sorted separated material types
contamination recylates material must prevented
increase recyclates value facilitate easier reprocessingultimate recycling facility sorting performed either
producer waste within semi fullyautomated
material recovery facilities

two common household method helping increase recycling
firstly kerbside collection curbside collectionconsumer leave presorted material recycling frontproperty typically box sack collected recycling

morepopulated sites

paper recycling began britain inwhen british waste paper

benefits

recycling beneficial two way reduces input energyraw material production system reduces amount waste
produced disposal

material like aluminium recycled indefinitelychange material recycled material like paper require
percentage raw material wood fiber added compensate
degradation existing fibers

since material processed purer energy neededprocess energy needed transport placeextraction bauxitealuminium ore mine brazil coniferous
forest scandinavia

reduces environmental social usually economic costs
manufacturing

example bauxite mine brazil displace indigenous people create
noise pollution blasting machinery transport create air
pollution form particulate dust habitat lossvisual destruction also negative aesthetic qualityarea local environment however mine provide
employment revenue local population economy promoting
development country whole

recycling aluminium savesof energy cost processing new
aluminium melting temperature reduced fromc 
c

commonly used method waste disposal landfill proloysis
incineration environmentally damaging unsustainable therefore
way reduce volume waste disposed fashion
beneficial maximum environmental benefit gained waste
minimization reducing amount waste produced reusing items
current form refilling bottles
