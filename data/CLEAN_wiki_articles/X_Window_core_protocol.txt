colors

protocol level colour represented bit unsigned
integer called pixelvalue following element affectrepresentation colors
colour depth
colormap table containing red green blue
intensity values
visual type specifies table used represent
colors

easiest case colormap table containing rgb triplerow pixelvalue represents colour contained xth
row table client change entry colormap
representation identified pseudocolor visual classvisual class staticcolor similar client cannot changeentry colormap

total six possible visual class one identifying
different way representing rgb triple pixelvalue
pseudocolor staticcolor two grayscale staticgraytwo differing shade gray used

two remaining visual class differ onebreak pixelvalues three part use three separate tablered green blue intensity according colour
representation pixelvalue converted rgb triplefollows
pixelvalue seen sequence bits

mechanism requires colormap composed three separate

six mechanism representing color pixelvaluesrequire additional parameter work parametercollected visual type contains visual classparameter representation color server fixed set
visualtypes one associated numerical identifieridentifier bit unsigned integer necessarily
different identifier resource atoms

connection client accepted acceptance packet
sent server contains sequence block one containing

visual type acceptance packet containsidentifier actual parameter contains visual class etc
client store information cannot request afterwards
moreover client cannot change create new visual type requests

atoms

atom bit integer representing string protocol designers
introduced atom represent string short fixed
size string may arbitrarily long atom alwaysbit integer atom short exploited mandatinguse kind packet likely sent many timestring result efficient use network
atom fixed size exploited specifying fixed sizeevent namelybytes fixedsize packet contain atomcannot contain long strings

precisely atom identifier string stored serversimilar identifier resource window pixmaps etc
differ two way first identifier atomchosen server client word client
request creation new atom sends serverstring stored identifier identifier chosenserver sent back reply client second important
difference resource atom atom associated
client created atom survives server quitsreset default behaviour resources

atom identifier therefore unique however atomresource identifier coincide string associated atomcalled atom name name atom cannot changedcreation two atom name resultname atom commonly used indicate atom atom abcd
mean precisely atom whose associated string abcdatom whose name abcd client request creationnew atom request atom identifier given
string atom predefined created server given
identifier string

atom used number purpose mostly relatedcommunication different client connected server
particular used association propertywindow described
list atom residing server printed usingprogram xlsatoms particular program print atomidentifier number name associated string

properties

every window predefined set attribute setproperty stored server accessible client via
appropriate request attribute data windowsize position background colour etc property arbitrary pieces
data attached window contrary attribute propertymeaning level window core protocol clientstore arbitrary data property window

property characterized name type value properties
similar variable imperative programming languageclient create new property given name type storevalue property associated window two propertyname exist two different window different
type values

name type value property string precisely
atom string stored server accessibleclient via identifier client application access given
property using identifier atom containing nameproperty

property mostly used interclient communication example
property named wmname property named atom whose
associated string wmname used storing namewindow window manager typically read property displayname window title bar

type interclient communication use property root
window example according freedesktop window manager
specificationwindow manager store identifiercurrently active window property named netactivewindowroot window resource contain parameter programalso stored property root window way clientaccess even running different computers

xprop program print property given window xprop root

x server work eight modifier however modifier
associated one key necessarymany keyboard duplicated key modifier example
many keyboard two shift key one left oneright two key produce two different keycodes pressedx server associate shift modifier

eight modifier server maintains listkeycodes consider modifier examplelist first modifier shift modifier contains keycode
x key produce keycode considered shift

list modifier mapping maintained serverchanged every client example client request thef
key added list shift modifier pointkey behaves like another shift modifier however keycode
corresponding still generated key pressedresult operates example help window mayopened pressed also operates like shift key
pressing text editor add current

x server maintains modifier mapping mouse
button however button permuted mostly
useful exchanging leftmost rightmost button lefthanded

authorization

client initially establishes connection serverserver reply either accepting connection refusingrequesting authentication authentication request contains name
authentication method use core protocol doe specify
authentication process depends kind authentication
used end server either sending acceptance
refusal packet

xlib client libraries

client program communicate server via xlib client
library particular client use library xaw motif
gtk turn use xlib interacting serveruse xlib following effects
xlib make client synchronous respect replyevents
xlib function send request blockappropriate reply expected receivedword window client using xlib sendrequest server operationwaiting reply client using xlib call
xlib function sends request waitreply thus blocking client waiting reply
unless client start new thread callingfunction
server sends event asynchronously xlib stores
event received client queue client program
access explicitly calling functionx library word client forced blockbusywait expecting event
xlib doe send request server immediately stores
queue called output buffer requestoutput buffer actually sentprogram explicitely request calling library
function xflush
program call function give result something
involve reply serverxgetwindowattributes
program asks event event queue example
calling xnextevent call block example
xnextevent block queue empty

higherlevel library turn used xawmotif allow client program specify callback functions
associated event library take care pollingevent queue calling appropriate function requiredevent indicating need redrawing windowhandled internally 
lowerlevel library xcb provide asynchronous accessprotocol allowing better latency hiding
