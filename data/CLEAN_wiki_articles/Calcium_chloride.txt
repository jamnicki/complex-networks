usually take form small white ball millimetrediameter called prills see picture top page

used concrete mix help speed initial setting
however chloride ion lead corrosion steel rebarsused reinforced concrete

used dust control highway hygroscopic
nature keep liquid layer surface roadwayhold dust
calcium chloride taste extremely salty used ingredient
food especially pickle give salty tasteincreasing food sodium content

also used ingredient canned vegetable maintain
firmness

used additive plastics

used drainage aid wastewater treatment

aqueous calcium chloride used genetic transformation cells
increasing cell membrane permeability allows dna
fragment enter cell readily

tire ballast
additive fire extinguishers
additive control scaffolding blast furnaces

used make ersatz caviar vegetable fruit
juices

used smartwater sport drink electrolyte

precautions

calcium chloride irritant wear glove goggles protect
hand eye avoid inhalation

although calcium chloride relatively safe handle caretaken ingested calcium chloride reacts exothermically
water burn mouth esophagus
