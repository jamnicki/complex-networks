organization

military setup

mongol turkic military organization simple effectivewa based old tradition steppe decimal system
known iranian culture since achaemenid persia later imitated
eg mughal indiathe army built squad ten men
called arban ten arbans constituted company hundred
called jaghun ten jaghuns made regiment thousand called
mingghan ten mingghans would constitute regiment ten
thousand tumen equivalent modern division

army discipline distinguished mongol soldier peers
force command mongol empire generally
tailored mobility speed maximize mobility mongol soldiers
relatively lightly armored compared many armyfaced addition soldier mongol army functioned
independently supply line considerably speeding army movement
discipline inculcated nerge traditional hunt reportedjuvayni

military campaign preceded careful planning
reconnaissance gathering sensitive information relatingenemy territory force success organization mobilitymongol army permitted fight several frontmale aged fromtoand capable undergoing rigorous
training eligible conscription army sourcehonour tribal warrior tradition

unlike mobile fighter hun vikingmongol comfortable art siegecareful recruit artisan city plundered along
