plato make clear phaedo form universalia
ante rem universal concept idea makephenomenal world intelligible consequently orderintellect important aspect mind philosophydescartes access kind knowledge regardaspect universe must necessarily nonphysical
immaterial entity property entityclear basis text plato powerful
precursor descartes subsequent stringent formulationdoctrine substance dualism

aristotle strongly rejected plato notion form independently
existing entity metaphysics already point central
problem idea one hand sayparticular phenomenal world participate share form

neoplatonism scholasticism

early christianity seems struggled come termidentification unique position regard questionrelationship mind body struggled definerelationship ontological status christ see
homoousianism homoiousianism arianism etc early middle
age consensus seemed emerge around called
neoplatonism doctrine neoplatonism essentially minor
modification plato general idea immortalitysoul nature form neoplatonic christian identified
form soul believed soul substanceindividual human body shadow copy
eternal phenomena

later philosopher following neoaristotelian trail blazedthomas aquinas came develop trinitarian notion formparalleled trinitarian doctrine father son holy spirit
form intellect soul three aspect partsingular phenomenon aquinas soul intellect remainedsubstance human somewhat similarly aristotles
proposal manifestation inside human body
person could said person soul intellect
form could exist independently body unlike aristotle
soul constitute person hence aquinas
suggested instead saying peter pray onerather say something like soul peter pray sinceremained peter death soul things
connected body personal memory cancelledend one corporeal existence

different view question modern christianity
official catholic church doctrine illustrated apostles
creed claim second coming christ body reunited
soul resurrection whole person bodysoul heaven hell hence sortinseparability soul mind body even strongly
reminiscent aristotle position expressed thomas
aquinas

revisionist protestant theologian accept doctrineinsist instead immaterial soul hence mindintellect heaven leaving body brain behindforever

still christian including seventhday adventist teachsoul exists doe survive death citing biblical
claim dead know nothing person thought perish
die according view death like sleep
consciousness lost death restored resurrected
body resurrection concept soul distinctbody would therefore redundant

type ontological dualism

ontological dualism make dual commitment natureexistence relates mind matter dividedthree different types

substance dualism asserts mind matterfundamentally distinct kind substances

property dualism suggests ontological distinction
lie difference property mind matter
emergentism

predicate dualism claim irreducibility mental
predicate physical predicates

substance dualism

substance dualism type dualism famously defendeddescartes state two fundamental kindsubstance mental material mental doe extensionspace material cannot think substance dualism viewpoint
contradicts physicalism one popular view modern
philosophy mind however may regarded important
historically given rise much thought famous
mindbody problem may also noted philosophical
interpretation quantum mechanicsespecially consciousness
cause collapse interpretationare revival substance
dualism since view generally claim observer entangledobject observed separate substance casesubstance dualism substance dualism philosophical position
compatible theology claim immortal soul occupy
independent realm existence distinctphysical world david chalmers recently developed thought experiment
inspired movie matrix substance dualism couldtrue consider computer simulation bodycreature controlled mind mind remain strictly
external simulation creature sciencewant world never able figuremind exist observable universe
case substance dualism respect computer
simulation naturally differs computer simulationmind part simulation case substance monism
would true

property dualism

property dualism asserts matter organizedappropriate way way living human bodyorganized mental property emerge hence subbranchemergent materialism different version property dualism describe
different way epiphenomenalism asserts material
cause give rise sensation volition idea etc mental
phenomenon cause nothing causal deadends
interactionism hand allows mental causeproduce material effect viceversa

predicate dualism

predicate dualism view espoused nonreductive
physicalists donald davidson jerry fodor maintain
one ontological category substanceproperty substance usually physical predicate use
describe mental event cannot redescribed term reduced
physical predicate natural language characterize
predicate monism view subscribed eliminative materialists
maintain intentional predicate believe desire
think feel etc eventually eliminated language
science ordinary language entityrefer exist predicate dualism easily defined
negation position predicate dualist believesocalled folk psychology propositional attitude
ascription ineliminable part enterprise describing
explaining understanding human mental state behaviour

davidson example subscribes anomalous monism accordingstrict psychophysical law connect mental
physical event description mental physical
event however mental event also physical descriptionterm latter event connected lawlike
relation physical event mental predicate irreducibly
different character rational holistic necessary physical
predicate contingent atomic causal

parallelism

psychophysical parallelism unusual viewinteraction mental physical event waprominently perhaps truly advocated gottfried wilhelm von
leibniz like malebranche others leibniz recognizedweakness descartes account causal interaction taking placephysical location brain malebranche decidedmaterial basis interaction material immaterialimpossible therefore formulated doctrine occasionalism
stating interaction really caused interventiongod individual occasion leibniz idea god createdpreestablished harmony seems physicalmental event cause caused one another reality mental

argument dualism come several varieties

subjective argument support dualism

important argument physicalism hence favoursort dualism consists idea mentalphysical seem quite different perhaps irreconcilable
properties

mental event certain subjective quality whereas
physical event obviously example doe burned
finger feel like doe sky blue look like doe nice music
sound like

philosopher mind call subjective aspect mental events
qualia raw feel something like feel pain
see familiar shade blue qualia involved
mental event claim qualia seem particularly
difficult reduce anything physical

special science argument

argument say predicate dualism correctspecial science irreducible physicirreducible special science source allegedly

zombie argument

zombie argument based thought experiment proposed david
chalmers basic idea one imagine therefore conceive
existence one body without conscious stateassociated
chalmers argument seems plausiblecould exist needed things
physical science describe zombie must truesince none concept involved science make referenceconsciousness mental phenomenon move conceivability
possibility large one

argument personal identity

argument concern difference applicabilitycounterfactual conditionals physical object one handconscious personal agent case material
object printer formulate series counterfactualsfollowing manner

printer could made straw
printer could made kindplastic vacuumtube transistors

somewhere along way printer made exactlypart material actually constitute printermade different matter saythe question whether
printer printer becomes matter arbitrary
convention

mentally identical frederick doe make sense saysomething mentallyfrederick

argument dualism

argument causal interaction

variety dualism mind causally affect matter come
strenuous attack different quarter especially startingth century something totally immaterial affect something
totally material thats basic problem causal interactionanalyze problem three parts

first clear interaction would take placeexample burning finger cause pain apparently chain
event leading burning skin stimulationnerve ending something happening peripheral nervebody lead brain something happening particular part
brain finally resulting sensation pain pain
supposed spatially localizable doeinteraction take place respond take placebrain might say thought pain werent located
anywhere dualist might stick gun say
thats right pain arent located anywhere brain eventimmediately lead pain located brainstrange causal relation hand cause located
particular place effect located anywhere perhaps
devastating criticism

let look second problem interaction namelydoe interaction take place might think well thatsmatter sciencescientists eventually discoverconnection mental physical event philosopher also
something say matter idea mechanism
explains connection mental physical would
strange best would strange comparemechanism understand take simple causal relation
cue ball strike eight ball cause pocket say cue ball certain amount
momentum mass move across pool table velocity
momentum transferred eight ballhead toward pocket compare situationbrain want say decision cause neuron firethus cause body move across room intentioncross room mental event doephysical property force forceearth could cause neuron fire magic could
something without physical property physical effect
might reply philosopher indeed repliedfollows well sure mystery interaction
mental physical event occur factmystery doesnt mean interaction plainlyinteraction plainly interaction two totally
different sort event problem responsedoe seem answer full power objection

let try explain objection precisely let takeexample decision walk across room say decisionmental event immediately cause group neuron brainfire physical event ultimately result walking across
room problem something totally nonphysical
causing bunch neuron fire physical event
cause firing mean physical energy seemsappeared thin air even say decision hasort mental energy decision cause firingstill havent explained physical energy firing came
seems popped existence nowhere

conservation energy causal closure

one main objection dualistic interactionism pointeddifficult impossible understand
two completely different type substance materialimmaterial able interact causally one responsepoint perhaps causal interaction take placeclassical billiard ball type newtonian mechanicinstead involves energy dark matter mysterious
processes

even latter true argued stillproblem interaction seem violate fundamental lawphysic external unknown source energy responsible
interaction example would violate lawconservation energy hand conservation laws
apply closed isolated system since humanclosed isolated system interactionist would arguelaw conservation absolutely apply case

along line argue dualistic interactionismviolates general heuristic principle science causal
closure physical world mill respondedpointing mental event may causally overdetermined causal
overdetermination mean feature effect mayfully explained sufficient cause example high pitched
music caused glass break third timeglass broken last week certain highpitched
music sufficient cause breaking glassexplain feature event identified phrase
third time week feature causally
related sense two prior event glassbroken last week response pointedprobably focus inherent intrinsic featuresituation event exist apply idea causal
closure specific features

moreover question determinism versus indeterminismquantum mechanism event microscopic level leastindeterminate precisely localize positionelectron imprecise becomes ability determineangular momentum viceversa philosopher karl popperjohn eccles theorized indeterminacy may apply evenmacroscopic scale scientist however insisteffect indeterminacy cancel larger levels

argument brain damage

argument formulated paul churchland among otherspoint simply brain undergoes kind damage
caused automobile accident drug abuse pathological diseases
always case mental substance andor propertyperson significantly compromised mind completely
separate substance brain could possible every
single time brain injured mind also injured indeedfrequently case one even predict explainkind mental psychological deterioration change human
undergo specific part brain damagedquestion dualist try confrontexplained mind separate immaterial substanceproperty ontologically independent brain

argument biological development

another common argument dualism consists idea since
human phylogenetically ontogenetically beginexistence entirely physical material entity since nothing
outside domain physical added later course
development must necessarily end fully developed
material phylogenetically human specie evolvedspecie single cell made matter sinceevent later occurred ended formationspecie explained process random mutationnatural selection difficulty dualist explaincould intervened nonmaterial nonphysical
event process natural evolution ontogenetically begin
life simple fertilized ovum nothing nonmaterialmentalistic involved conception formation blastulagastrula development explained entirely terms
accumulation matter process nutritioncould nonphysical mind possibly come
argument simplicity

argument simplicity probably simplest alsocommon form argument dualism mental dualistalways faced question anyone find necessary
believe existence two ontologically distinct entities
mind brain seems possible would make simpler
thesis test scientific evidence explain events
property term one heuristic principle science
philosophy assume existence entitynecessary clear explanation prediction see occam razor
