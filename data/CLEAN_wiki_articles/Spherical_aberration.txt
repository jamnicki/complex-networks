optic spherical aberration image imperfection occurs
due increased refraction light ray occurs rays
strike lens reflection light ray occurs rays
strike mirror near edge comparison strike
nearer centre often considered imperfectiontelescope instrument make focusing leideal due spherical shape lens mirrorimportant effect spherical shape much easier produceaspherical lens spherical shapes

effect proportional fourth power diameterinversely proportional third power focal lengthmuch pronounced short focal ratio fast lenses

small telescope using spherical mirror focal ratio shorter
f light distant point source starfocused point particularly light striking inner
part mirror focus farther mirror light striking
outer part result image cannot focused sharplyaberration present spherical aberration
telescope shorter usually made nonspherical
mirror correcting lenses

lens system effect minimized using special combinations
convex concave lens well using aspheric lenses
