salient features

reading frame sequence

note codon defined inital nucleotidetranslation start example string gggaaaccc readfirst position contains codon ggg aaa cccand readsecond position contains codon gga aac read
starting third position gaa acc partial codonignored example every sequence thus read three
reading frame produce different amino acid
sequence given example glylyspro glyasp gluthr
respectively doublestranded dna six possible reading
frame three forward orientation one strand three
reverse opposite strand

actual frame protein sequence translated definedstart codon usually first aug codon mrna sequence
mutation disrupt reading frame insertion deletionone two nucleotide base known frameshift mutationmutation may impair function resulting proteinformed thus rare vivo proteincoding sequence often
misformed protein targeted proteolytic degradation one
reason rareness frameshifted mutation inheritedprotein translated essential growthselective pressure organism face absence functional protein
may cause lethality organism viable

degeneracy genetic code

many codon redundant meaning two codon codeamino acid degenerate codon may differ third
position gaa gag code amino acid glutamic
acid codon said fourfold degenerate nucleotidethird position specifies amino acid saidtwofold degenerate two four possible nucleotidethird position specify amino acid twofold degenerate
codon equivalent third position nucleotide always either two
purine two pyrimidine two amino acidspecified single codon one aminoacid methionine

base per codon onlyamino acid could coded 
leastcodes required thengivespossible
codon meaning degeneracy must exist

property genetic code make faulttolerantpoint mutation example theory fourfold degenerate codons
tolerate point mutation third position although codon
usage bias restricts practice many organism twofold
degenerate codon tolerate one three possible point
mutation third position since transition mutation purinepurine pyrimidine pyrimidine mutation likelytransversion purine pyrimidine viceversa mutationequivalence purine pyrimidine twofold degenerate
site add faulttolerance

practical consequence redundancy errorgenetic code cause silent mutation error wouldaffect protein hydrophilicity hydrophobicitymaintained equivalent substitution amino acid examplecodon nun nany nucleotide tends code hydrophobic
amino acid even single point mutation causemodified hemoglobin molecule sicklecell disease hydrophilic
glutamate glu substituted hydrophobic valine valreduces solubility globin case mutation causes
hemoglobin form linear polymer linked hydrophobic
interaction valine group causing sicklecell deformation
erythrocyte sicklecell disease generally caused novo mutation rather selected malarial regionsimilar way thalassemia heterozygous peopleresistance malarial plasmodium parasiteheterozygote
