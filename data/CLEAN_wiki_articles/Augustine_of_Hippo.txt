doctrine original sin

augustine theological view early middle erarevolutionary perhaps none much clear formulationdoctrine original sin substantially influenced catholic
theology

idea predestination rest assertion god foreseen
time immemorial choice every person would ever live
earth would make whether would cooperate gracenumber people god know would saved elect
number god know saved reprobate godchosen elect certainly gratuitously without previous merit
ante merita part

yet augustine also maintains firmly god savemen god doe destroy human liberty free choice preserves
elect would potentially full powerdamned nonelect full power saved


augustine hippo

according augustine god creative decree expressly
excluded every order thing grace would deprive manliberty every situation man would powerresist sin thus augustine brush aside predestinationism
ha attributed listen speakingmanichans saved wish retractations
x far correcting assertion confirmsemphatically true entirely true menwish always back providential preparationsermon say depends elect cxx etc elect wish lxxiii say according augustine list elect
reprobate closed nonelect gain heavenelect lost pas one listforget celebrated explanation augustine god
made plan knew infallibly choice wouldresponse men grace listdefinitive one pas one seriesanyone cannot contrary god
knew infallible knowledge one would wish thus cannot
effect god destine another series graceha fixed grace saveable wish

augustine hippo

augustine theory predestination misunderstoodsemipelagianists john calvin teaching double predestination god already explicitly decided would savedwould damned predestined fate wayleave room free personal choice cooperationgrace

pelagians augustine also strongly stressed importance
