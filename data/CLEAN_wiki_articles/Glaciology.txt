types

two general category glaciation glaciologists
distinguish alpine glaciation accumulation river ice
confined valley continental glaciation unrestricted
accumulation covered much northern continents
alpineice flow valley mountainous area forms
tongue ice moving towards plain alpine glaciers
tend make topography rugged
