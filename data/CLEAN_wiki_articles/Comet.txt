first book meteorology aristotle propounded viewcomet would hold sway western thought nearly two thousand
year rejected idea several earlier philosophercomet planet least phenomenon related planets

instead described comet phenomenon upper atmosphere
hot dry exhalation gathered occasionally burst flame
aristotle held mechanism responsible comet also
meteor aurora borealis even milky way

later classical philosopher dispute view comets
seneca younger natural question observed comets
moved regularly sky undisturbed wind
behaviour typical celestial atmospheric phenomenonconceded planet appear outside zodiacsaw reason planetlike object could move part
sky humanity knowledge celestial thinglimited however aristotelean viewpoint proved influential
wa century demonstratedcomet must exist outside earth atmosphere

ina bright comet visible several month danish
astronomer tycho brahe used measurement comet position taken
