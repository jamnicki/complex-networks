heavier air

heavier air aircraft aerodynes include autogyro helicopters
gyrocopters conventional fixedwing aircraft aeroplanes
fixedwing aircraft generally use internalcombustion engineform piston engine propeller turbine engine jetturboprop provide thrust move craft forwardair movement air wing produce lift causeaircraft fly exception include glider enginegain thrust initially winch tuggravity thermal current glider maintain forward
speed must descend relation air necessarilyrelation ground helicopter autogyro use spinning rotor
rotary wing provide lift helicopter also use rotorprovide thrust gyrodynes aircraft intermediate helicopters
autogyro whose rotor sometimes powered often jettip tail rotor heliplanes combination
aircraft rotor wing take land
vertically hover like helicopter use wing high
speed flight abbreviationvtol applied aircrafttake land verticallystol stand short takelanding

lighter air
