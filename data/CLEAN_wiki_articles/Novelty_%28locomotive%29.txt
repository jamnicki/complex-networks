boiler used forced draught provided mechanical blowertriangular structure right illustration forced air

difference original replicacarbon steel used instead wrought iron

wrought iron longer commercially produced carbon
steel understood every commercial fabricator

boiler built welded steel instead copper

copper boiler would expensive materialwould needed specialist skill welded steel much
common industrial pressure vessels

blower built plywood painted copper colour

blower likely subject development
work plywood much cheaper easier workadditionally people would get close enough telldifference

handbrake fitted act wheels

boiler fitted gauge glass bourdon pressure gauge

requirement steam boiler vital engine waoperated safely

safety valve pop type rather dead weight safety valve

firstly pop valve type used industry secondly
dead weight type could held would never work
properly thirdly dead weight valve tends bouncethus wasting steam

boiler replica contains approximately twice volume
water

mainly result construction method used
flanged joint barrel standard steel pipeflue tube also gave bigger water spaceinside outside plate consequence fire grate must
