possible emergency procedures

caib determined nasa management acted time two
possible contingency procedure available rescue missionshuttle atlantis emergency spacewalk attempt repairleft wing thermal protection

rescue

caib determined rescue mission though risky mightpossible provided nasa management took action soon enough

normally rescue mission isnt possible due time requiredprepare shuttle launch limited consumables power
water air orbiting shuttle however atlantis well alongprocessing marchlaunch columbia carried unusually
large quantity consumables due extended duration orbiter edo
package caib determined would allowed columbiastay orbit flight dayfebruarynasa investigators
determined atlantis processing could expeditedskipped safety check februarylaunch hence nothing went
wrong five day overlap possible rescue

repair

nasa investigator determined onorbit repair shuttle astronauts
wa possible risky primarily due uncertain resiliencyrepair using available materials

columbia carry canadarm remote manipulator system
would normally used camera inspection transportingspacewalking astronaut wing therefore unusual emergency eva
would required astronaut eva trainingmaneuvering wing astronaut always prepared similarly
difficult emergency evato close external tank umbilical doors
located orbiter underside launch door open
propellant feed line external tank supply main
engine orbiter tail fail close jettisoning
external tank constitutes thermal protection breachwould destroy orbiter upon reentry requires emergency eva
close manually similar method could reached shuttle
left wing inspection repair

repair caib determined astronaut would use
tool small piece titanium metal scavengedcrew cabin heavy metal would help protect wing structure
would held place reentry waterfilled bagturned ice cold space ice metal would help
restore wing leading edge geometry preventing turbulent airflowwing therefore keeping heating burnthrough level low
enough crew survive reentry bail landing
nasa team could verify repair would survive
even modified reentry rescue option considerably higher
chance bringing columbia crew back alive
