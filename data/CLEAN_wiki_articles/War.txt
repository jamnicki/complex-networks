factor leading war

cause war many varied examined
historically view understanding war prosecutingeffectively recently view avoidingbasically cause war mean motive

populace example case third punic war romes
leader may wished make war carthage order bring
annihilation resurgent rival army may wished
make war carthage since great opportunity plunder

therefore single war may many contributory motivationcause various theory presented historically explain

malthusian theories

pope urban inon eve first crusade wroteland inhabit shut side seamountain peak narrow large populationscarcely furnishes food enough cultivator hencemurder devour one another wage war many
among perish civil strife let hatred therefore departamong let quarrel end enter upon road holy
sepulcher wrest land wicked race subject

malthusian theory war war caused expanding
population limited resource thomas malthuswrote

rationalist theories

rationalist theory war assume side potential war
rational say side want get best
possible outcome least possible loss lifeproperty side given assumption country knew
advance war would turn would betteraccept postwar outcome without actually pay
cost fighting war based notion generally
agreed almost scholar war since carl von clausewitzwar reciprocal war require decision attack
also decision resist attack rationalist theory offer three
reason country cannot find bargain instead resortwar issue indivisibility information asymmetry incentivedeceive inability make credible committments

issue indivisibility occurs two party cannot avoid warbargaining thing fighting cannotshared owned entirely one sidereligious issue control temple mount jerusalem
likely indivisible economic issues

bigger branch theory advanced scholar international
relation geoffrey blainey problem information
asymmetry incentive misrepresent two country mayagree would win war whether victory wouldoverwhelming merely eked side military secrets
capability avoid bargaining failure
sharing secret since cannot trust lie
exaggerate strength extract concession example
sweden made effort deceive nazi germany would resistattack fiercely partly playing myth aryan superioritymaking sure hermann gring saw elite troop action
often dressed regular soldier came visit

intelligence gathering may sometimes always mitigateproblem example argentinean dictatorship knew united
kingdom ability defeat intelligence failed
question whether british would use powerresist annexation falkland island american decisionenter vietnam war made full knowledgecommunist force would resist believeguerrilla capability long oppose american forces

thirdly bargaining may fail due state inability make
credible committments scenario two country mightable come bargain would avert war could stickbenefit bargain make one side powerful
lead demand even future weaker side
ha incentive make stand
rationalist explanation war critiqued numberground assumption costbenefit calculation become dubiousextreme genocial case world war bargain
offered case infinitely bad rationalist theories
typically assume state act unitary individualbest state whole problematicexample country leader beholden small numberpeople personalistic dictatorship rationalist theory also
assumes actor rational able accurately asslikelihood success failure proponentpsychological theory would disagree

rationalist theory usually explicated game theory
