education

planck extremely gifted came music took singing
lesson addition playing piano organ cellocomposing song opera however instead music chose study
physics

munich physic professor philipp von jolly advisedgoing physic saying field almost everythingalready discovered remains fill holes
planck replied wish discover new thingunderstand known fundamental field began studies
inat university munich jolly supervision planck
performed actual experiment scientific career
studying diffusion hydrogen heated platinum soon
transferred theoretical physics
