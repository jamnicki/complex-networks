principles

edema increase interstitial fluid organ generally
amount interstitial fluid balance homeostasis
increased secretion fluid interstitium impaired removal
fluid may cause edema

generation interstitial fluid regulated starling equationtissue fluid state depends balance osmotic
pressure hydrostatic pressure across capillary walls
consequently anything increase oncotic pressure outside blood
vessel example inflammation reduces oncotic pressureblood state low plasma osmolality example cirrhosiscause edema increased hydrostatic pressure inside blood vessel
example heart failure effect

abnormal removal interstitial fluid caused obstructionlymphatic system example due pressure cancer enlarged
lymph node destruction lymph vessel radiotherapyinfiltration lymphatics infection elephantiasis

peripheral edema

edema without modifier usually refers peripheral dependent
edema accumulation fluid part bodyaffected gravity ambulatory people leg although
bedbound first manifestation may sacral edema
severe enough peripheral edema may progress involveabdominal even thoracic wall may referred generalized
edema anasarca particular edema state nephrotic
syndrome see periorbital edema around eye maypresent

phenomenon may distinguish different cause peripheral edema
peripheral edema pitting edemapressing leadshift interstitial fluid formation small pitresolve second nonpitting edema may reflect lymphedema form
edema develops lymph vessel obstructed

cause peripheral edemahigh hydrostatic pressure vein leading poor
reabsorption fluid
venous obstruction deep vein thrombosis typically
onesided
congestive heart failure
varicose veins
asymmetric compression thigh leg knee pads
tight jeans

common usually harmless appearance cuteneous edema observed
mosquito bite skin contact certain plantsurticaria

primarily excessive accumulation water
