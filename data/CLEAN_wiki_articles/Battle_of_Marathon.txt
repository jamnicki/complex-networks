conclusion

marathon sense decisive victory persian however
wa first time greek bested persian landvictory endowed greek faith destinywa endure three century western cultureborn jfc fuller military history western world john
stuart mill famous opinion battle marathon waimportant event british history battle hastings
kampouris see battle failure purely maritime operations
due inherent weaknesses

longestlasting legacy marathon double envelopmenthistorian claimed random rather conscious decision
miltiades say really cannae cannaehoplitic battle two side usually stronger centre
either weakest point right sidestrongest point left side however miltiadesepaminondas matter quality quantity
miltiades personal experience persian army knewweakness course action battle show invasions
cyclades island integrated strategy upon defeating
persian hence reason could thoughtgood tactic double envelopment used ever since eggerman army used tactic battle tannenberg world war
similar used greek marathon
