formation

crude oil found oil reservoir form earth crustremains living thing crude oil properly know petroleum
kind fossil fuel scientific evidence indicatesmillion year heat pressure changed remainsmicroscopic plant animal remains crude oil natural gas

move migrate become oil gas reservoir

addition water environment mentioned usually sea
might also river lake coral reef algal mat formation
oil gas reservoir also requires sedimentary basinpass four step burial mile sand mud pressure
cooking hydrocarbon migration source porous rocktrapping impermeable rock timing also important
consideration suggested ohio river valley couldmuch oil middle east one time escaped due
lack trap north sea hand endured millions
year sea level change successfully resultedformation thanoilfields

although process generally various environmental
factor lead creation wide variety reservoirs
