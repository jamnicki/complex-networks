genotypic understanding heredity felt lackingprevious study heredity focused phenotypic approaches
prominent latter approach biometric schoolkarl pearson wfr weldon based heavily statistical
study phenotype variation strongest opposition school
came william bateson perhaps early days
publicizing benefit mendel theory word genetics
much discipline terminology originatedbateson debate biometricians mendelianextremely vigorous first two decade twentieth century
biometricians claiming statistical mathematical rigor
