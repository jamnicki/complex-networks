methodology

crucial unique task engineer identify understand
interpret constraint design order producesuccessful result usually enough build technically
successful product must also meet requirement constraints
may include available resource physical imaginative technical
limitation flexibility future modification additionfactor requirement cost marketability
producibility serviceability understanding constraints
engineer derive specification limit within viable
object system may produced operated

problem solving

time man began make clever invention pulley
lever wheel etc exact etymology word engineer
however person occupationally connected study design
implementation engine word engine deriveslatin ingenium cmeaning innate quality especially mental
power hence clever invention hence engineer essentiallysomeone make useful practical inventions

rise engineering profession nineteenth century
term became narrowly applied field mathematics
science applied end similarly additionmilitary civil engineering field known mechanic
art became incorporated engineering
