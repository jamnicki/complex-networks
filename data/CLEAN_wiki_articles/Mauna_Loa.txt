flank collapse

greater rarer hazard mauna loa possibility sudden
massive collapse volcano flank deep fault allow large
portion side hawaiian mountain slide gradually

mauna loa intensively monitored volcano hawaiian volcano
observatory hvo established observe hawaiian
volcano hvo developed many technique help predict
eruption mauna loa volcano imminent

one important tool seismology 
seismometers around big island allow scientist measureintensity location hundred small earthquake every week
earthquake begin increase year eruption actually
start theanderuptions preceded one two
year increased seismic activity depth thankm

another type seismic activity occurs hour precedingeruption socalled volcanic tremor continuous rumblecontrast normal seismic activity sudden shockbelieved caused rapid movement magma underground
volcanic tremor normally indicates imminent eruption althoughmay also caused shallow intrusion magma reach
surface

another important indicator happening undergroundshape mountain tiltmeters measure small changeprofile mountain sensitive equipment measure distances
point mountain magma fill shallow reservoirs
summit rift zone mountain inflates survey line
across caldera measured amm increase widthyear preceding theeruption similar increaseeruption
