acute viral nasopharyngitis often known common cold mild
viral infectious disease upper respiratory systemnosethroat symptom include sneezing sniffling runny nose nasal
congestion scratchy sore phlegmy throat coughing headachetiredness cold typically last three five day residual
coughing lasting three week common human

pathology

common cold caused numerous virus mainly rhinoviruses
coronaviruses also certain echovirus paramyxoviruscoxsackievirus infecting upper respiratory system several
hundred coldcausing virus described virusevolve survive ensuring cure still long waynasopharynx central area infected reason virus
concentrate nasopharynx rather throat may low
temperature high concentration cell receptor neededvirus

transmission

virus transmitted person person dropletcough sneeze droplet droplet nucleus either inhaled
directly transmitted hand hand via handshake objects
door knob introduced nasal passagehand touch nose eyes

virus take advantage sneeze cough infect next
person defeated body immune system sneeze expel
significantly larger concentration virus cloud coughing
cloud partly invisible fall rate slow enough last
hourswith part droplet nucleus evaporating leaving much
smaller invisible droplet nucleus air dropletturbulent sneezing coughing hand contact also last hours

symptoms

mechanism infection

virus enters cell lining nasopharynx area
nose throat rapidly multiplies major entry
point normally nose also eye case
drainage nasopharynx would occur nasolacrimal
duct mouth major point entry transmissionusually occur kissing swallowing

virus enters cell binding icam receptorcell presence icam affect whether cell infected
concentration also affected various factors
including allergic rhinitis irritant including
rhinovirus icam major focal point drug
research cold treatments

symptoms

ninetyfive percent people exposed cold virus become infected
although onlyshow symptom symptom startdaysinfection generally cold start sore throat withoutrespiratory blockage onwards symptom resultbody defense mechanism sneeze runny nose cough expel
invader inflammation attract activate immune cells

common cold sufferer develops immunity particular
virus encountered however large number different
cold virus immunity offer limited protection person
therefore easily infected different type cold virus
starting process
complications

bacteria normally present respiratory tract take
advantage weakened immune system common coldproduce coinfection middle ear infection child bacterial
sinusitis common coinfections possible explanationcoinfections strong blowing nose drive nasal fluids
areas

best way blow nose keeping nasal opening openblowing wiping rather fully covering permitting pressure
partially dissipate reduce pressure would
otherwise drive fluid ear sinuses

prevention

best way avoid cold avoid close contact existing
sufferer wash hand thoroughly regularly avoid
touching face antibacterial soap effect cold
virusit mechanical action hand washing removevirus particle inthe center disease controlprevention recommended alcohol based hand gel effective method
reducing infectious virus hand however standard
handwashing alcohol gel provide residual protectionreinfection tobacco smoking also linked weakening
immune system nonsmoker known average take fewer
day sick smoking population

large variety virus causing common cold
vaccination impractical

treatment

body immune system effectively destroy invaderprocess generally take aboutdays healthy individual warm
clothing including sock found alleviate suffering
cold may composed several million viral particletypically within day body begin mass producing better
tailored antibody prevent virus infecting cellwell white blood cell destroy virus phagocytosis
destroy infected cell prevent viral replication since

infection thus ineffective common cold treatment
