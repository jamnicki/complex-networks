nowextinct marine animal called graptolites thrived oceans
cystoids crinoid appeared

ordovician flora

first terrestrial plant appeared form tiny plants
resembling liverwort pollen fossil found latest
ordovician plant probably evolved green algae green algaecommon ordovician late cambrian perhaps earlier

fungal life

first land fungi probably appeared latest ordovician
following plant even fossil spore time
however marine fungi abundant ordovician sea decompose
animal carcass wastes
