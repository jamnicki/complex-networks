stability aside commodity based currency limiting rapidly
growing active economy supply money economy must
equal greater volume trade commodity used
money money supply must equal total amount goods
service sold large economy volume trade easily
outstrip supply one commodity

problem compounded fact money also serfstore value encourages hoarding take commodity money
circulation reducing supply supply circulating
commodity currency reduced fact commodity moneys
also competing nonmonetary example gold silverused jewelery nickel copper important industrial uses

commodity based currency also limit geographic extenttrading market make large purchase either large volume high
