steam engine

four year opening shop watt began experiment steam
friend professor john robison called attentionpoint watt still never seen operating steam enginetried constructing model failed work satisfactorilycontinued experiment began read everythingcould independently discovered importance latent heatunderstanding engine unknown black famously
discovered year learned university ownedmodel newcomen engine london repair watt gotuniversity returned made repair initbarely worked much experimentation showedheat steam consumed heating cylinder
steam condensed injected stream cold
water critical insight cause steam condenseseparate chamber apart piston maintain temperature
cylinder temperature injected steam came
finally inand soon working model

came long struggle produce fullscale engine required
capital came black substantial backing
came john roebuck founder celebrated carron iron
work near falkirk formed partnershipprincipal difficulty machining piston cylinder iron
worker day like blacksmith machinistresult left much desired much capital spent pursuinggroundbreaking patent day required actparliament strapped resource watt forced takeemployment surveyor eight year roebuck went bankruptmatthew boulton owned soho foundry work near birmingham
acquired patent right watt boulton formed hugely successful
partnershipboultonwatt lasted next twentyfive
years

watt finally access best iron worker world
difficulty manufacture large cylinder tightly
fitting piston solved john wilkinson developed precision
boring technique cannon making bersham near wrexham north
wale finally inthe first engine installed working
commercial enterprise first engine used pumpproduced reciprocating motion order began pournext five year watt busy installing engine mostlycornwall pumping water mines

field application invention greatly widenedboulton urged watt convert reciprocating motionpiston produce rotational power grinding weaving milling
although crank seemed logical obvious solutionconversion watt boulton stymied patent whose
holder john steed associate proposed crosslicenseexternal condensor watt adamantly opposed circumvented
patent sun planet gear 

next six year made number improvementmodification steam engine double acting enginesteam acted alternately two side piston onethrottle valve control power engine centrifugal
