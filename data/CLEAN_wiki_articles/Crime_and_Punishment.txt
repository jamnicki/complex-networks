dunyas complete rejection dostoevsky hold ideasalvation possible option people evensinned grievously realization fact leadraskolnikov confession although dunya could never love svidrigailov
sonya love raskolnikov exemplifies trait ideal christian
forgiveness allowing raskolnikov confront crime acceptpunishment

christian existentialism

central idea christian existentialism defining moral
boundary human action within god ruled world raskolnikov
