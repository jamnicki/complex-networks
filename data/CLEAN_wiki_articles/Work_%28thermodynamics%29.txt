overview

according first law thermodynamics useful separate
change internal energy thermodynamic system two sorts
energy transfer work refers form energy transferaccounted term change macroscopic physical
variable system example energy expanding
volume system external pressure say drivingpistonhead cylinder external forcedistinction heat energy carried systemform transfer microscopic thermal motion particles

concept thermodynamic work little generalmechanical work also includes energy transfer example electrical work movement charge external
electrical field charge battery say may maynecessarily thought strictly mechanical nature

mathematical definition

stipulated first law thermodynamics net increaseinternal energy thermodynamic system must fully accounted
term heat entering system work donesystem

dudelta qdelta 
roman letter indicates internal energy propertystate system change internal energy exact
differentialsthey depend original state final
state path taken contrast greek equation
reflect fact heat transfer work transferproperty final state system given initial
state final state system one saytotal change internal energy much energy went
heat much work summarised saying
heat work state function system

pressurevolume work

chemical thermodynamics study work occurs volume
fluid change work represented following
differential equation

dwp 

wwork done system
pexternal pressure
vvolume

therefore
wintvivf pdv

like work function work pathdependent pathquestion curve euclidean space specified fluids
pressure volume infinitely many curve possible
thermodynamic perspective fact implies workstate function mean differential inexact
differential rigorous written line

mathematical point view say exact
oneform line merely flag warn uactually functionform potential dwindeed function able use stokes
theorem evaluate putative function potential dwboundary path initial final pointtherefore work would state function impossibilityconsistent fact doe make sense referwork point work presupposes path
