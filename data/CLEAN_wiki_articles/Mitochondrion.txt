outer membrane

outer mitochondrial membrane encloses entire organelle

membrane aboutby weight contains numerous integral proteins
called porins contain relatively large internal channelnm permeable molecule ofdaltons less
larger molecule traverse outer membrane active
transport also contains enzyme involved diverse activities
elongation fatty acid oxidation epinephrine

inner membrane

inner mitochondrial membrane contains protein four typefunctions

hypothesis suggests mitochondrion descended specialized
bacteria probably purple nonsulfur bacteria somehow survived
endocytosis another specie prokaryote cell type
