early years

mariner paul elder brother felix committed suicide
marchand younger sister beatrice early family life
appears unhappy due father unusually strictauthoritarian nature educated first bishop road primary
school merchant venturer technical college later cotham

dedicated largely classic something dirac would
later express gratitude

dirac studied electrical engineering university bristol
completing degree inhe decided true calling

religious views

dirac believe personal god said god used
beautiful mathematics creating world may used
god synonymous nature

werner heisenberg recollects friendly conversation among young
participant thesolvay conference einstein plancks
view religion wolfgang pauli heisenberg dirac took partdirac contribution poignant clear criticismpolitical manipulation religion much appreciatedlucidity bohr heisenberg reported later amongthing dirac said cannot understand idle discussing
religion honestand scientist honesty precise
dutywe cannot help admit religion pack false
statement deprived real foundation idea godproduct human imaginationi recognize religious
myth least contradict one anotherheisenbergs
view tolerant pauli kept silent initial remarks
finally asked opinion jokingly said well
id say also friend dirac got religion first
commandment religion god doe exist paul diracprophet everybody burst laughter also dirac
