explanation

human perceive sound sense hearing sound commonly
mean vibration travel air heard humans
however scientist engineer use wider definition soundincludes low high frequency vibration air cannot heard
human vibration travel form matter
gas liquid solid matter support sound called
medium sound propagates wave alternating pressure causing
local region compression rarefaction particle medium
displaced wave oscillate scientific study sound
called acoustics

noise sound often mean thing noise often usedrefer unwanted sound science engineering noiseundesirable component obscures signal

sonar human determine spatial information wayperceive sounds

human generally hear sound frequency betweenhz 
khz although range varies significantly age occupational
hearing damage gender majority people longer hear
hz time teenager progressively loseability hear higher frequency get older human speech
communication take place betweenandhz human earsensitive frequency aroundhz soundhearing range known ultrasound hearing range

sound pressure

sound pressure pressure deviation local ambient
pressure caused sound wave sound pressure measured usingmicrophone air hydrophone water unit sound
pressure pascal symbol instantaneous sound pressure
deviation local ambient pressure caused sound wave
