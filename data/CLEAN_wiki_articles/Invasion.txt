nationstates potentially hostile neighbor typically adopt
defensive measure delay forestall invasion additionutilizing geographical barrier river marsh rugged
terrain measure historically included fortificationdefense intended actively prevent invading forceentering country mean extended welldefended barrier
hadrian wall great wall china danewerk famous
example barrier also included trench linemodern time minefield camera motionsensitive sensors

modern time notion constructing largescale static defenses
combat land based threat largely become obsolete useprecision air campaign largescale mechanization made
lighter mobile defense desirable military planner nations
defending modern invasion normally use large population
center city town defensive point invader must
capture point destroy defender ability wage wardefender mobile armored infantry division protectpoint defender still mobile normally
retreat prominent example use city fortificationseen iraqi army stand theinvasion iraqbaghdad tikrit basra major combat second gulf wardefender also use mobile asset precipitatecounteroffensive like soviet red army battle kursknorthern alliance afghanistan

however static emplacement remain useful defensenaval attack defense air attack naval mine stillinexpensive effective way defend port choke supply
line large static air defense system combine antiaircraft guns
missile launcher still best way defend air
attack system used effectively north vietnamese
around hanoi also united state invested considerable time
money construction national missile defense systemstatic defense grid capable intercepting nuclear intercontinental
ballistic missiles

island nation united kingdom japan continental
state extensive coast united state utilized
significant naval presence forestall invasion country
rather fortifying border area successful naval defense
however usually requires preponderance naval powerability sustain service defence force

particularly large nation defending force may also retreatorder facilitate counter attack drawing invader deeper
hostile territory one effect tactic invading
force becomes spread making supply difficult makingline susceptible attack tactic although costly helped
russian stop german advance stalingrad also cause
invading force extend far allowing pincer movement cut
reinforcement cause british defeat
battle cowpens american revolutionary war
finally sending many reinforcement leave defenderattacker territory allowing counterinvasion areas

invasion air invention century modern warfare
idea involves sending military unit territory aircraft
aircraft either land allowing military unit debarkattempt objective troop exit aircraft stillair using parachute similar device land territory
invaded many time air assault used pave way
ground seabased invasion taking key position deep
behind enemy line bridge crossroad entirely
airbased invasion never succeeded two immediate problemresupply reinforcement large airborne force cannot adequately
supplied without meeting ground force airborne forcesmall simply place immediate envelopment situation
argument favour method generally relate abilitytarget specific area may necessarily easily accessibleland sea greater chance surprising enemy overwhelming

application regarding nonstate combatants

th century question arose regardingeffectiveness invasion strategy neutralising nonstate
combatant type warfare sometimes referred toespeciallyusasfourth generation warfare case onecombatant group controlled centralized state government
independent leadership group may madecivilian foreign agent mercenary politician religious leaders
member regular military group act smaller
number confined border necessarily dependdirect support state group easily
defeated straightforward invasion even constant occupationcountry regular army may defeated government may replaced
asymmetric warfare part group continued
indefinitely regular armed force unitflexibility independence small covert cell many believeconcept powerful occupying force actually createsdisadvantage

opposing theory hold response extremist ideologyunjust government invasion change government reeducate
people making prolonged reistance unlikely averting future
violence theory acknowledges change may take
timegenerations casesbut hold immediate benefit may
still reducing membership choking supply lines
covert cell proponent invasion strategyconflict maintain belief strong occupying force still
succeed goal tactical level building upon numerous small
victory similar war attrition

contemporary debate issue still fresh neither sideclaim know certain strategy ultimately effective
defeating nonstate combatant opponent invasion strategy
