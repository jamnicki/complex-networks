name killer whale widely used common english however
since orca steadily grown popularity common

pod orca capable killing large whale commonly
thought thcentury spanish sailor dubbed creatures
asesinaballenas whale killer reason howevertitle improperly translated english killer whaleterm became prevalent spanish speaker commonly usedretranslation ballena asesina
