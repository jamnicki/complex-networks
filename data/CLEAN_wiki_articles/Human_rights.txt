criticism human rights

one argument made concept human rightsuffers cultural imperialism particular concepthuman right fundamentally rooted politically liberal outlook
although generally accepted western europe japan indianorth america necessarily taken standard elsewhereappeal often made fact influential human rights
thinker john locke john stuart millwestern indeed involved running empires
cultural imperialism argument achieves even greater
potency made basis religion historyhuman right emphasise christian influence agendaquestion whether keeping tenet world
religion example inthe iranian representativeunited nation said rajaiekhorassani articulated positioncountry regarding universal declaration human right saying
udhr secular understanding judeochristian
tradition could implemented muslim without
trespassing islamic law

yet feel cultural imperialism argument entirely
factual western political philosopher like locke hobbesmill made important contribution development modern notions
human right concept human right origin many
world culture religion additionally argument leadabsolute relativism taken far viewpoint moral
framework equally valid one cannot condemn behaviour
however outrageous horrific practice human right offer basis
criticise behaviour conduct including imperialismhuman right transformative tool selfdetermination

one way cultural imperialism relativism debateargue body human right exists hierarchyundergo derogation relationship different rightcomplex since argued mutually reinforcingsupportive example political right right hold
office cannot fully exercised without social cultural
prerequisite decent education whether lattertherefore included firstgeneration right debated point

however argued idea human right entirely
universal impose universally may harmful
consequence western developed state often stress neednegative right construct developing world seekpositive right construct regard progress human rights
institution written heart peoplecannot changed overnight page law book changing
de jure institution doe mean imply transformative
change facto institution norm govern long term
behavor ellermanwithout internal motivation external
leverage hamper local human right progress

another important philosophical criticism human rightpresumed basis morality moral belief fundamentally
expression individual personally held preferenceobjective morality upon human right founded rejected
richard rorty argued human right based uponexercise reason sentimental vision humanity even thoughdoe support human right law basis interest theory
alasdair macintyre written belief right parbelief witch unicorn without care criticismbecome apology behaviour aligns closely moral
relativism offends claiming moral beliefpersonally held preference objective criterion
deduce valid moral belief
final set debating point revolves around questionduty uphold human right human right historically arisen
need protect citizen abuse statemight suggest mankind duty intervene protect
people wherever divisive national loyalty emphasise
difference people rather similarity thusseen destructive influence human right movementdeny people innately similar human quality others argue
state sovereignty paramount least oftenstate signed human right treaty first place
