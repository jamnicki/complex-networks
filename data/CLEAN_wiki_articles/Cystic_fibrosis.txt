cystic fibrosis common hereditary disease affectentire body causing progressive disability early death difficulty
breathing common symptom result frequent lung

fibrosis die youngmany lung failure
ultimately lung transplantation often necessary worsens

cf caused mutation gene called cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator cftr product gene
help create sweat digestive juice mucus although people
without two working copy cftr gene one needed
prevent cystic fibrosis develops neither gene works
normally therefore considered autosomal recessive disease

antibiotic treat lung disease

antibiotic given whenever pneumonia suspected hadecline lung function antibiotic often chosen basedinformation prior infection many bacteria common cystic
fibrosis resistant multiple antibiotic require weektreatment intravenous antibiotic vancomycin tobramycin
meropenem ciprofloxacin piperacillin prolonged therapy
often necessitates hospitalization insertion permanent picc line portacath inhaled therapy antibiotics
tobramycin colistin often given month timeorder improve lung function impeding growth colonized

hearing loss kidney problem longterm use order prevent
side effect amount antibiotic bloodroutinely measured adjusted accordingly

method treat lung disease

several mechanical technique used dislodge sputum encourage
expectoration hospital setting physical therapyutilized therapist pound individual chesthand several time day device recreate percussive
therapy include thairapy vest intrapulmonary percussive
ventilator ipv portable adapted home use aerobic
exercise great benefit people cystic fibrosisdoe exercise increase sputum clearance improves cardiovascular
overall health

aerosolized medication help loosen secretion include dornase
alfa hypertonic saline dornase recombinant human
deoxyribonuclease break dna sputum thus decreasing
viscosity nacetylcysteine may also decrease sputum viscosityresearch experience shown benefit minimal
albuterol ipratropium bromide inhaled increase sizesmall airway relaxing surrounding muscles

lung disease worsens breathing support machine may become

transplantation gene therapy

lung transplantation often becomes necessary individualcystic fibrosis lung function exercise tolerance declines
although single lung transplantation possible diseases
individual must lung replaced remaining
lung would contain bacteria could infect transplanted lungpancreatic liver transplant may performed timeorder alleviate liver disease andor diabetes lung transplantation
considered lung function approach point threatens
survival requires assistance mechanical devices

gene therapy hold promise potential avenue cure cystic
fibrosis gene therapy attempt place normal copy cftr gene
