airship dirigible buoyant aircraft steeredpropelled air unlike aerodynamic craft airplanehelicopter stay aloft moving airfoil airorder produce lift aerostatic craft airship balloons
stay aloft primarily mean cavity usually quite large filled

terminology

dirigible balloon time word balloon droppedphrase

term zeppelin genericised trademark originally referred
airship manufactured zeppelin company

modern common usage term zeppelin dirigible airshipused interchangeably type rigid airship terms
blimp airship alone used describe nonrigid airship modern
technical usage however airship term used aircrafttype zeppelin referring aircraftmanufacture blimp referring nonrigid airships

term airship sometimes informally used mean machine
capable atmospheric flight

contrast airship balloon buoyant aircraft generally
rely wind current movement though vertical movementcontrolled
often confusion around term aerostat regardairship confusion arises aerostat two different
meaning one meaning aerostat refers craft remain aloft
using buoyancy sense airship type aerostatnarrow technical meaning aerostat referstethered balloon second technical sense airshipdistinct aerostats airshipaerostat confusion often

characteristic heavierthanair airplane helicopterlighter air technology example include helicopterairship
hybrid intended heavy lift application dynamic lift
airship intended longrange cruising notedairship fully loaded cargo fuel typically
heavier air thus must use propulsion systemshape generate aerodynamic lift necessary stay aloft
technically making hybrid airship however term hybrid
airship refers craft obtain significant portionlift aerodynamic lift often require substantial takeoff

lifting gas

early day airship primary lifting gas hydrogen
airship except united states
continued use hydrogen offered greater liftcheaper helium united state sole producer
wa also unwilling export helium rareconsidered strategic material however hydrogen flammablemixed air quality think contributed hindenburg
disaster well rigid airship disaster buoyancy
provided hydrogen actually aboutgreaterheliumthe issue therefore became one safety versus cost

american airship filled helium sincemodern passengercarrying airship often law prohibitedfilled hydrogen nonetheless small experimental ships
still use hydrogen today
