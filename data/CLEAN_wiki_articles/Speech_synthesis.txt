synthesizer technologies

important quality speech synthesis systemnaturalness intelligibility naturalness describes closelyoutput sound like human speech intelligibility easeoutput understood ideal speech synthesizernatural intelligible speech synthesis system trymaximize characteristics

two primary technology generating synthetic speech waveforms
concatenative synthesis formant synthesis technologystrength weakness intended synthesis system
typically determine approach used

concatenative synthesis

concatenative synthesis based concatenation stringing
together segment recorded speech generally concatenative
synthesis produce naturalsounding synthesized speech
however difference natural variation speechnature automated technique segmenting waveforms
sometimes result audible glitch output three
main subtypes concatenative synthesis

unit selection synthesis

unit selection synthesis large database recorded speech
database creation recorded utterance segmentedfollowing individual phone syllable morphemes
word phrase sentence typically division segmentdone using specially modified speech recognizer set forced
alignment mode manual correction afterward using visual
representation waveform spectrogram indexunit speech database created based segmentation
acoustic parameter like fundamental frequencypitch
duration position syllable neighboring phone runtime
desired target utterance created determining best chain
candidate unit database unit selection processtypically achieved using specially weighted decision tree

unit selection provides greatest naturalness applies
small amount digital signal processing dsp recorded
speech dsp often make recorded speech sound natural although
system use small amount signal processing pointconcatenation smooth waveform output best
unitselection system often indistinguishable real human
voice especially context system tuned
however maximum naturalness typically require unitselection speech
database large system ranging gigabytes
recorded data representing dozen hour speech

freely available software implementations

domainspecific synthesis

domainspecific synthesis concatenates prerecorded word phrasecreate complete utterance used applicationvariety text system output limited particular
domain like transit schedule announcement weather reporttechnology simple implement commercial use
long time device like talking clock calculatorlevel naturalness system highvariety sentence type limited closely matchprosody intonation original recordingsystem limited word phrase databasegeneralpurpose synthesize combinationword phrase preprogrammed

formant synthesis

formant synthesis doe use human speech sample runtime
instead synthesized speech output created using acoustic
model parameter fundamental frequency voicing noise
level varied time create waveform artificial speech
method sometimes called rulesbased synthesis however many
concatenative system also rulesbased components

many system based formant synthesis technology generate artificial
roboticsounding speech would never mistaken human speech
however maximum naturalness always goal speech
synthesis system formant synthesis system advantageconcatenative system formantsynthesized speech reliably
intelligible even high speed avoiding acoustic glitches
commmonly plague concatenative system highspeed synthesized
speech used visually impaired quickly navigate computers
using screen reader formant synthesizer usually smaller
program concatenative system database
speech sample therefore used embedded systems
memory microprocessor power especially limitedformantbased system complete control aspectoutput speech wide variety prosody intonationoutput conveying question statement varietyemotion tone voice

example nonrealtime highly accurate intonation controlformant synthesis include work done late texas

challenges

text normalization challenges

process normalizing text rarely straightforward textfull heteronym number abbreviation require
expansion phonetic representation many spellingenglish pronounced differently based context example
latest project learn better project voice contains
two pronunciation project

texttospeech system generate semantic
representation input text processreliable well understood computationally effective result
various heuristic technique used guess proper waydisambiguate homograph like examining neighboring word using
statistic frequency occurrence

deciding convert number another problem systems
address simple programming challenge convertnumber word likebecoming one thousand three hundred
twentyfive however number occur many different contextpart addressshould likely read thirteen
twentyfive part social security number one three
two five system often infer expand number basedsurrounding word number punctuation sometimes system
provides way specify context ambiguous

similarly abbreviation ambiguous exampleabbreviation inch must differentiated word
tt system intelligent front end make educated guesses
ambiguous abbreviation others provide resultcase resulting nonsensical sometimes comical outputs

texttophoneme challenges

speech synthesis system use two basic approach determinepronunciation word based spelling process often
called texttophoneme graphemetophoneme conversionphonemeterm used linguist describe distinctive soundlanguage simplest approach texttophoneme conversiondictionarybased approach large dictionary containingword language correct pronunciation storedprogram determining correct pronunciation word matter
looking word dictionary replacing spelling
pronunciation specified dictionary approach
rulebased pronunciation rule applied worddetermine pronunciation based spellingsimilar sounding synthetic phonics approachlearning reading

approach advantage drawback dictionarybased
approach quick accurate completely fails givenword dictionary dictionary size growsdoe memory space requirement synthesis systemhand rulebased approach work inputcomplexity rule grows substantially system takeaccount irregular spelling pronunciation consider word
common english yet wordletter pronounced result nearly speech synthesis
system use combination approaches

language like spanish regular writing systemprediction pronunciation word based spellings
quite successful speech synthesis system language often
use rulebased method extensively resorting dictionaryword like foreign name borrowing whose
pronunciation obvious spelling hand
speech synthesis system language like englishextremely irregular spelling system likely relydictionary use rulebased method unusual wordword arent dictionaries
