recreational environmental activity virtually human
us require fresh water onlyof water earth fresh
water two third frozen glacier polar ice
cap water demand already exceeds supply many part world
many area expected experience imbalancenear future framework allocating water resource water
user framework exists known water rights

water conflict

throughout history water resource occasionally source
conflict example include
well poisoning
privatization water pricing india 
privatization water pricing protest cochabamba bolivia

nevertheless claim issue doe get attentiondeserves particular regard security

threat fresh water

many thing threat earth fresh water
supply
climate change

climate change significant impact water resource around
world close connection climatehydrologic cycle rising temperature increase evaporationlead increase precipitation though regional
variation rainfall overall global supply freshwaterincrease drought flood may become frequentdifferent region different time dramatic change snowfall
snowmelt expected mountainous area higher temperatures
also affect water quality way well understood
possible impact include increased eutrophication climate change could
also mean increase demand farm irrigation garden sprinklers
perhaps even swimming pools

depletion aquifers

since competition water growing underground aquiferbecoming depleted mainly due irrigation groundwater
million small pump currently taking water aquiferirrigate crop irrigation dry area india suppliedgroundwater

us fresh water

us fresh water categorized consumptivenonconsumptive sometimes called renewable use waterconsumptive water immediately available another use
loss subsurface seepage evaporation considered
consumptive water incorporated product farm
produce water treated returned surface watersewage generally considered nonconsumptive waterput additional use

aquaculture small growing agricultural use water
freshwater commercial fishery may also considered agricultural

purpose include drinking water bathing cooking sanitation
gardening basic household water requirement estimated

water lot recreational value

recreational water use small growing percentage total
water use recreational water use mostly tied reservoirreservoir kept fuller would otherwise recreation
water retained could categorized recreational usage
release water reservoir also timed enhance
whitewater boating also could considered recreational
usage example angler water skier nature enthusiastswimmers

recreational usage nonconsumptive however may reduceavailability water user specific time placeexample water retained reservoir allow boating late
summer available farmer spring planting season
water released whitewater rafting may availablehydroelectric generation time peak electrical demand

environmental

natural wetland

explicit environmental water use also small growing
percentage total water use environmental water usage includes
artificial wetland artificial lake intended create wildlife
habitat fish ladder around dam water release reservoirs
timed help fish spawn

like recreational usage environmental usage nonconsumptive may
reduce availability water user specific timeplace example water release reservoir help fish spawn
may available farm upstream

adequate sanitation suggests growing conflictagricultural water user currently consume majoritywater used humans

generally speaking developed country north america
europe russia see serious threat water supplyyearnot relative wealthimportantly population better aligned available
water resource north africa middle east south africanorthern china face severe water shortage due physical
scarcity condition overpopulation relative carrying
