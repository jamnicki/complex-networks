chemical synapsis specialized junction cellnervous system signal one another nonneuronal cellmuscle gland chemical synapse motor neuronmuscle cell called neuromuscular junction

chemical synapsis allow neuron central nervous systemform interconnected neural circuit thus crucialbiological computation underlie perception thought also

word synapse come synaptein sir charles scott

synapsis exist well without qualifier however synapsecommonly refers chemical synapse

anatomy

prototypical chemical synapse found dendritic
spine mushroomshaped bud project two cellcap bud press flat one another interface
membrane two cell flank across slender gap
narrowness enables signalling molecule knownneurotransmitter pas rapidly one celldiffusion gap aboutnm wide knownsynaptic cleft

synapsis asymmetric structure operate
socalled presynaptic neuron secretes neurotransmitter
bind receptor facing synapse postsynaptic
cell presynaptic nerve terminal also called synaptic button
bouton generally bud tip axonpostsynaptic target surface typically appears dendrite cell

zone membrane two adjacent cell held close contact
cell adhesion protein immediately behind postsynaptic
membrane elaborate complex interlinked protein calledpostsynaptic density protein postsynaptic density servemyriad role anchoring trafficking neurotransmitter
