second aor hour period

clock used technical purpose high accuracy usually
called chronometer common portable timekeeping instrumentpersonal used pocket wrist watch

true clock also announcing striking mechanism sounds
set interval time usually ringing bellpreviously indicated originally gave clock name chimegong silent clock without striking mechanism traditionally
