gastrointestinal symptoms

abdominal pain may initial symptom crohn disease pain
commonly crampy may relieved defecation often
accompanied diarrhea may bloody naturediarrhea crohn disease depends part small intestine
colon involved ileitis typically result largevolume
watery feces colitis may result smaller volume feces higher
frequency fecal consistency may range solid watery severe

seen setting crohn colitis bloody bowel movementtypically intermittent may bright dark red coloursetting severe crohn colitis bleeding may copious flatusbloating may also add intestinal discomfort

symptom caused intestinal stenosis also common crohns
disease abdominal pain often severe area bowelstenosis setting severe stenosis vomiting nausea may

diagnosis crohn disease sometimes challengingnumber test often required assist physician making
diagnosis

endoscopy

colonoscopy best test making diagnosis crohns
disease allows direct visualization colon terminal
ileum identifying pattern disease involvementprocedure gastroenterologist also perform biopsy taking
small sample tissue laboratory analysis may help confirm
diagnosis asof crohn disease involves ileum

radiologic tests

small bowel followthrough may suggest diagnosis crohns

treatment

treatment needed people exhibiting symptomtherapeutic approach crohn disease sequential treat acute
disease maintain remission treatment initially involves
use medication treat infection reduce
inflammation usually involves use aminosalicylate
antiinflammatory drug corticosteroid may include
antibiotic surgery may required complicationobstruction abscess disease doe respond drugs
within reasonable time

remission induced goal treatment becomes maintenanceremission avoiding flare sideeffects prolonged use
corticosteroid must avoided although people ablemaintain remission aminosalicylates alone many require
immunosuppressive drugs
