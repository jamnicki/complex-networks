etymology

originally radio radioteleography called wireless telegraphy
wa shortened wireless prefix radio sensewireless transmission first recorded word radioconductor
coined french physicist edouard branly inand basedverb radiate latin radius mean spoke wheel beamlight ray radio noun said coinedadvertising expert waldo warren whitethe word appearsarticle lee forest adopted united state navybecame common time first commercial broadcasts
united state noun broadcasting came
agricultural term meaning scattering seed american
term adopted language europe asia although
british commonwealth country retained term wirelessmidth century japanese term wireless basisterm radio wave although term device listensradio wave literally device receiving sounds

recent year term wireless gained renewed popularity
rapid growth short range networking wlan
