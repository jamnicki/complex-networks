american community like literature sometimes
showcase black people

existing inside outside american literature

according james madison university english professor joanne gabbin
african american literature exists inside outside american
literature somehow african american literature relegateddifferent level outside american literature yet integral
part says

view african american literature grounded many wayexperience black people united state even though
african american long claimed american identityunited state history accepted full citizenresult part america also outside
said african american literature exists
fully within framework larger american literature also
exists entity result new style storytellingunique voice created isolation benefitnew style voice leave isolation help
revitalize larger literary world mckaythis artistic
pattern held true many aspect african american culture
last century jazz hip hop two artistic
example developed isolation within black communityreaching larger audience eventually revitalizing american
culture

whether african american literature keep patterncoming year remains seen since genre already popular
mainstream audience possible ability develop
new style voicesor remain authentic wordcriticsmay thing past

balkanization american literature

argue african american literature exists partbalkanization literature last decadeextension culture war field literature according
critic literature splitting distinct separate
grouping rise identity politics united states
part world critic reject bringing identity
politics literature would mean woman could
write woman woman black black blacks

people opposed groupbased approach writing saylimit ability literature explore overall human condition
importantly judge ethnic writer merely basisrace critic reject judgment say defiesmeaning work like ralph ellison invisible man ellisons
main character invisible people see nothingblack man others criticize special treatment ethnicbased
genre literature example robert hayden first
africanamerican poet laureate consultant poetry librarycongress said paraphrasing comment black composer
duke ellington jazz music thing black
literature good literature bad thats
