cataract extracapsular intracapsular surgery extracapsular
surgery consists removing lens leaving majoritylens capsule intact high frequency sound wavesphacoemulsification
sometimes used break lens extraction
intracapsular surgery involves removing entire lens eye
including lens capsule rarely performed modern
practice either extracapsular surgery intracapsular surgery
cataractous lens removedreplaced plastic lensintraocular lens implant remains permanently eye

cataract operation usually performed using local anaestheticpatient allowed home day recent
improvement intraocular technology allow cataract patientchoose multifocal lens create visual environmentle dependent glass traditional intraocular lens monofocal
