sign symptoms

individual asthma characterized chronic respiratory
impairment others intermittent illness marked episodic
symptom may result number triggering event including
upper respiratory infection airborne allergen exercise

acute exacerbation asthma referred asthma attackclinical hallmark attack shortness breathdyspneaeither wheezing stridor although latter often regardedsine qua non asthma victim present primarilycoughing late stage attack air motion mayimpaired wheezing may heard present cough may
sometimes produce clear sputum onset may sudden sense
constriction chest breathing becomes difficult wheezing
occurs primarily upon expiration respiratory
phases
