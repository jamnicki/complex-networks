ha several interacting parts
collection economic data data consists measurable
value price change price measurable commodities
example cost hire worker week costparticular commodity much typically used

level employment includes observable form economic
activity money consumption preference buying selling
price economics typically employ two type equations

identity equation used explain certain economic values
calculated example relationship quantity theory
money shown equation exchange cdot cdot qthis often used find fast money circulateseconomy considered accounting measure another examplenational income identity equation tautologicalpurpose define rather explain

descriptive equation used describe economic agent
behaves example utility budget equation describe desires
limitation consumer combined yield demand
equation describe quantity product consumer seek
purchase various price similarly profit production
equation describe desire limitation firm combined
yield supply equation combining demand supply equations

many practical economic model form price stickinessincorporated model fact price move fluidly many

another area economic controversy whether price measures
value good correctly mainstream market economicssignificant scarcity factored price said
externalization cost benefit actorbuyer seller many example exist including
pollution cost others education benefit others
market economics predicts scarce good underpriced

externality effort correct distortion price causedexternalities

scarcity

neoclassical economics characterised maximization leisure time
wealth health happinessall commonly reduced conceptutility subject constraint constraintsor scarcity 
inevitably define tradeoff example one moneyworking harder time many hour day
time scarce one radish expenseexample fewer carrot much land grow
foodland scarce

economy world face scarcity

scarcity defined price zero quantity demanded
exceeds quantity supplied price measure relative scarcity
market variable held constant pricerising indicates commodity becoming relativelyscarce price falling indicates commoditybecoming relatively scarce

adam smith considered example tradeoff timeconvenience money discussed person could live near town
pay rent home live farther away pay less
paying difference convenience

marginalism

marginalist economic theory price level determinedmarginal cost marginal utility price goodcost making last one people purchase priceemployee company cost hiring last one
business need marginalism look decision basedmargin cost produce next unit versus muchexpected return profit marginal return action
reach zero action stop marginal utility muchhappiness use person receives purchase contrastbuying marginal reward often subject diminishing returns
le reward obtained production consumptionexample bar chocolate person consumes doetaste good first brings marginal utility

marginalism became increasingly important economic theorylate century tool used analyze economic
system react marginal cost production divide costfixed cost must paid regardless many commodity

termed marginal revolution economic thought
