pyrite marcasite

pyrite often confused mineral marcasite name derived
arabic word pyrite due similar characteristics
marcasite polymorph pyrite mean formula
pyrite different structure therefore different symmetry
crystal shape formal oxidation state howeverpyrite sulfur atom occur persulfidelike

diamond graphite pair

marcasite metastable relative pyrite slowly changed
pyrite heated given enough time marcasite relatively rare
may locally abundant type ore depositmississippi valleytype pbzn deposit marcasite appears formaqueous solutions

pyrite often used jewellery necklace braceletalthough two similar marcasite cannot used jewelleryha tendency crumble powder adding confusion
marcasite pyrite use word marcasitejewellery trade name term applied small polished faceted
stone inlaid sterling silver even thoughcalled marcasite actually pyrite

formal oxidation state pyrite marcasite arsenopyrite

perspective classical inorganic chemistry assigns
formal oxidation state atom pyrite probably best described
