evolutionary history

aboutmillion year ago bone mammuthus africanavusfound chad libya morocco tunisia mammuthus

despite african ancestry fact closely related
modern asian elephant either two african elephants
common ancestor mammoth asian elephant splitline african elephant aboutmillion year ago asian
elephant mammoth diverged half million year later
million year ago

due course african mammoth migrated north europe gave
rise new specie southern mammoth mammuthus meridionalis
eventually spread across europe asia crossednowsubmerged bering land bridge north america

whether general mammoth population died climatic reasondue overhunting human controversial another theory suggests
mammoth may fallen victim infectious disease
