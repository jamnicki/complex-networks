growing grain sorghum

plant potential grain production sorghum cannot plantedsoil temperature reachedc long growing season usually
day cause yield severely decreased plantground early enough

grain sorghum usually planted commercial corn seederdepth ofcm depending density soil shallowerheavier soil goal planting working fertile soiltoplants per hectare therefore average

insect disease prevalent sorghum crop bird however
