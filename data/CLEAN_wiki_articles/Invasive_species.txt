superior competition

common trait invasive specie great competitive abilitystronger plant new habitat plantnative habitat huge difference invasive
specie interacts native ecosystem ecosysteminvading often invading specie better chanceacquiring resource light water space nutrients
ecosystem available resource used full
capacity native plant modeled zerosum systemgain invader loss native however unilateral
competitive superiority instant equivalent extinction native
plant increased population invader rule
stolgrensax alinvasive plant coexistnative plant extended time gradually doesuperior competitive ability invasive specie become apparentpopulation grows larger denser slowly increase risk
extinction species

invasive specie might able use resource previously
unavailable native plant deep water source accessed
long taproot ability live previously uninhabited soil

reason invader might superior competitor
example invasive plant may inedible local herbivores

come increasing competition fewer fewer

facilitation

usually make favorable growth reproduction
sometimes neighboring specie may benefit anothers facilitation
often facilitation actually benefit target speciedetriment neighbor one facilitative mechanismallelopathy also known chemical competition allelopathyplant secrete chemical make surrounding soil

ecosystem based mechanisms

unfilled niches

basic ecology tell every specie role playnative ecosystem general others highly specialized
role known niche mechanism describes situation
invaded ecosystem question unfilled nichepromptly filled invader case invader
stay within niche specie often bring traits
cause harm rest ecosystem lack
suitable predator alleopathic traits

mechanism sound reasonable casual reader data
much mixed various experiment shown positive
negative neutral correlation ecosystem high
diversity invasiveness would arguemechanism may make sense theory doe pan wellliterature perhaps effect simply weakpowered mechanism perhaps concept missing niche
