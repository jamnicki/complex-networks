versions

term window collectively describes several
generation microsoft operating system productproduct generally categorized follows

bit operating environments

early version window often thought graphical
user interface desktop mostly startedmsdos used file system service however even earliest
bit window version already assumed many typical operating system
function notably executable file formatproviding device driver timer graphic printer mouse
keyboard sound application unlike msdos window allowed
user execute multiple graphical application time
cooperative multitasking finally window implementedelaborate segmentbased software virtual memory scheme allowed
run application larger available memory code segmentresource swapped thrown away memory became scarce
data segment moved memory given applicationrelinquished processor control typically waiting user input
example include windowsand windowsandclose relative windows

hybrid bit operating environments

however necessity keeping compatibility bit programs
meant gui component still bit fully
