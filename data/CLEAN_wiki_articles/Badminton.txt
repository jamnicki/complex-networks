scoring system development

traditional scoring system game played topoints
except woman single played toa matchdecided best three game serving player able
score point double player pair would serveservice returned side order regain service
receiving pair win two rally necessarily
consecutively

inthe ibf introduced new rule settingmeant player tied atoror
woman single player first reached score
could decide elect set play toor tofor womens
singles

inthe ibf concerned unpredictable often lengthy
time required match decided experiment different
scoring system improve commercial especiallybroadcasting appeal sport new scoring system shortened
game topoints decided match best ofgamesscore reachedthe player first reachedcould elect setpoints

yet match time remained issue since playing timetwo scoring system similar experiment abandonedreplaced modified version traditional scoring systemcommonwealth game last event used scoring system

decemberthe ibf experimented scoring system
intending regulate playing time simplify system
television viewer main change traditional systemadopt rally point scoring winner rally scorepoint regardless served game lengthened topoints
however new scoring system make game duration significantly

scoring system service

point shall added player score whenever win rally

match consists best three game game first
player scorepoints except score reachespointscase play shall continue one player either achievestwo point lead asor score reachesthe score
shall extend beyondis winning score

start match coin toss conducted playerpair winner coin toss may make one two choicemay choose whether serve receive first may chooseend court wish occupy made choice
opponent shall exercise remaining choice formal
setting coin toss often replaced hitting shuttleair whichever side point shall serve first

subsequent game winner previous game shall serve
first first rally double game serving pair may
decide serf receiving pair may decide receivesplayer shall change end start second game match
proceeds third game player shall change endstart game leading pair score reachespoints

single server shall stand right service courtscore even left service court score oddopponent shall stand diagonally opposite service court

double player shall remember service positionprevious rally receiver shall remain service courts
receiving pair win point thereby regains service
shall change service court position new score
even player right service court shall servenew score odd player left service court shall
serve thereafter continue win point server shall
alternate service court serfreceiver turn

several notable consequence system first rally
point scoring ensures start game fairerolder scoring system without rally point scoring servingstart game significant advantage secondsecond server unlike older scoring system thirdtime pair regains service service court law ensureserver shall player serve last

server receiver must remain within service courtfoot touch boundary line server
strike shuttle two player may stand whereverwish long unsight opposing server receiver

advanced stroke typically variation basic stroke oftenpurpose advanced stroke deceive opponent advanced
stroke may also used manipulate flight pathshuttlecock introducing spin spin may cause shuttlecockfollow curved path dip steeply falls

common technique advanced stroke slicing shuttle
hit angled racket face often player brush racket face
around shuttlecock achieve spin slice slices
used deceive opponent directionplayer going hit shuttle make apparently powerful
stroke travel slowly dropshot may disguised smash

lightness modern racket allows good player play many
stroke short swing skill provides opportunitydeception player may pretend play soft strokenetshot accelerate racket last momentplay powerful stroke lift form deception
may also reversed player may pretend play powerful stokedecelerate racket last moment play soft strokegeneral former type deception common towards front
court whereas latter type deception common
towards back court

another technique deception double motion technique
player make initial motion towards shuttlecockquickly withdraw racket hit shuttlecock different
direction aim show opponent one directionquickly place shuttlecock elsewhere player may even use
triple motion although much rarer

following list comprehensive scope advanced
stroke badminton large particular deceptive strokes

sliced strokes



sliced dropshot

shuttlecock heavily cause follow curved
path dip sharply cross nettwo type sliced dropshotsthe normal slicereverse slice normal slice playedshuttle left receiver think right
however reverse slice requires brushing
motion order slice shuttle rightopponent think drop played left



sliced smash

direction smash slicing smash also
allows player hit direction might

spinning netshot also called tumbling netshot
slicing underneath shuttlecock allows playerspin shuttlecock turn several
time cross net opponentunwilling address shuttlecockcorrected flight spin also make shuttlecock
fall tighter net

breaking wrist



racket head fakes

strategy

win badminton player need employ wide variety strokes
right situation range extraordinarily powerful
jumping smash soft delicate tumbling net return smashpowerful overhead stroke played steeply downwards middlerear opponent court similar tennis serve much
faster shuttlecock travel atkmhmpheffective stroke plea crowd smashing one
part game often rally finish smash settingsmash requires subtler stroke example netshot forceopponent lift shuttle give opportunity smashnetshot tight tumbling opponent liftreach back court make subsequent smash much
harder return

deception also important expert player make preparationmany different stroke look identical opponent cannot
guess stroke played many stroke shuttlecock
sliced change direction allows player moveracket different direction trajectory shuttlecock
opponent try anticipate stroke movewrong direction may unable change body momentum time
