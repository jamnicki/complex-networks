controversy

introduction anpr system led fear misidentification
furthering style surveillancein united states
gregg easterbrook oppose call machineissue speeding ticket redlight ticket beginningslippery slope towards automated justice system

machine classifies person offender cant

similar criticism raised country easterbrook
also argues technology employed maximise revenuestate rather promote safety

fallibility older system alarming one criticlondon congestion charge scheme noting misread plate misread
