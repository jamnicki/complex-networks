uncontrollable rapid movement although exhibit slow
movement stiffnessbradykinesia dystonia abnormal
movement gradually increase disease progress initially

cognitive

selective cognitive ability progressively impaired whereas
others remain intact ability affected executive function
planning cognitive flexibility abstract thinking rule acquisition
initiating appropriate inhibiting inappropriate actions
psychomotor function slowing thought process control muscles
speech actual language skill perceptual spatial skills

psychiatric

vary cognitive physical symptom may include
anxiety depression reduced display emotion called blunting
egocentrism aggressive behaviour compulsivity cause
addiction alcoholism gambling hypersexuality

management

treatment fully stop progression diseasesymptom reduced alleviated use correct
medication care methods

medication

treatment available help control chorea although
may side effect aggravating bradykinesia dystonia

standard treatment alleviate emotional symptom includeuse antidepressant sedative antipsychotic low
dos psychotic symptom care need takenantipsychotic usage people suffering psychotic symptom organic
origin often sensitive side effect drugs

nutrition

nutrition important part treatment sufferer need two
three time calorie average person maintain body
weight nutritionist advice needed average daily intakeapproximatelycalories woman andfor child men

speech therapy help improving speech swallowing methods

potential treatments

genetically modified exhibit movinghuman trials

research reviewed various website suffererfamily including huntington disease lighthouse hereditary

gene silencing

hopeful prospective treatment currently studied basedgene silencing since caused expression single gene
silencing gene could theoretically halt progressiondisease one study mouse model treated sirna therapy
achievedknockdown expression defective gene progression
disease halted full recovery motor function observedlate stage tethd mouse addition doxycycline

ethical aspects

whether test genetic counseling may provide
perspective risk disease chooseundergo testing due numerous concern example
insurability testing grandchild sufferer serious
ethical implication parent decline testing positive
