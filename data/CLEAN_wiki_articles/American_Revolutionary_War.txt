time expected lose britain several
military advantage outset vastly superior naval powerprofessional military standard day far greater
financial resource furthermore american often faced shortages
military supply traditional distrust central
government standing army made maintenance national
military force extremely difficult

suppressing rebellion america also posed problem sincecolony covered large area united war
