idea temperate zone first hypothesized ancient
greek scholar aristotle said earth divided three
type climatic zone based distance equator

thinking area near equator hot habitation
aristotle dubbed region around equator fromn 
torrid zone reasoned arctic circlepole permanently frozen called uninhabitable zonefrigid zone area aristotle believed livabletemperate zone lying frigid zone torrid
zone one reason aristotle believed temperate zone
wa best life could come fact livedzone

knowledge earth geography improved second frigid zone
wa discovered south equator around antarctic second
temperate zone discovered south equator

aristotle map vastly oversimplified although general idea
wa correct today commonly used climate map one developed
german climatologist amateur botanist wladimir kppen
