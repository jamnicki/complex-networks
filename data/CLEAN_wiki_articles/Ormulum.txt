content style

ormulum consists oflines metrical verse explicating
christian teaching text used mass throughoutchurch calendar first new homily cycle english
since work lfric cthe motivation provideaccessible english text benefit educated
englishman clergy could navigate latin vulgate
parishioner would understand spoken latin

homily begin paraphrase gospel reading followedexegesis theological content derivative orm closely follows
bede exegesis luke enarrationes matthoei glossa
ordinaria bible thus read verse primarily
allegorically rather literally rather identify individual
source orm refers frequently boc holy bookbennett speculated act apostle glossa ordinaria
bede bound together large vulgate bible abbeyorm truly getting material sourcesingle book bennett 

although sermon little literary theological value
burchfield orm posse one rhetorical devicerepetition bennett ormulum never intended bookmodern sense rather companion liturgy priest would
read congregation hear day entry time tedium
many experience attempting read ormulum today would
exist person hearing single homily timealthough orms poetry best subliterary homily meant
easy recitation chanting aesthetic appreciation
everything overly strict meter orthography might
function aid oratory

though earlier metrical homily lfric wulfstan
based rule old english poetry took sufficient
