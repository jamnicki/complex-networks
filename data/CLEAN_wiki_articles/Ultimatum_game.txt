experimental results

many culture people offer fair egsplits offers
le thanare often rejected result along similar

economicus model individual decision since individualreject positive offer choosing get nothing rathersomething individual must acting solely maximizeeconomic gain several attempt explain behaviouravailable author suggest individual maximizingexpected utility money doe translate directly expected

explanations

classical explanation ultimatum game wellformed
experiment approximating general behaviour often lead conclusion
homo economicus model economic selfinterest incomplete
however several competing model suggest way bring cultural
preference player within optimized utility functionplayer way preserve utility maximizing agentfeature microeconomics example researcher foundmongolian proposer tend offer even split despite knowingunequal split almost always accepted similar resultsmallscale society player led researcher conclude
thatreputation seen important economic reward
another way integrating conclusion utility maximizationform inequity aversion model preference fairness

explanation originally quite popular learning
model hypothesized proposer offer would decay
towards sub game perfect almost zero masteredstrategy game decay tends seen iterated
game however explanationbounded rationality less
commonly offered light empirical evidence
ha hypothesised james surowiecki unequal
allocation rejected absolute amount offer
low concept amount split ten
million dollar asplit would probably accepted ratherspurning million dollar offer essentially explanation says
absolute amount endowment significant enoughproduce strategically optimal behaviour however many experimentperformed amount offered substantial studycameron hoffman al found higher stakecloser offer approach even split even ausd game played

behaviour

variants

competitive ultimatum game many proposerresponder accept one offer three
nave proposer responder usually offered almost entire
endowment would nash equilibrium assuming collusion
among proposers

ultimatum game tippingif tip allowed responder
back proposer game includes feature trust gamesplit tend net equitable

reverse ultimatum game give power respondergiving proposer right offer many divisionendowment like game end responder
accepts offer abandon game therefore proposer tends
receive slightly half initial endowment
