thorium nuclear fuel

neutron produce uranium fissile hence like
u fertile one significant respect bettertwo fissile isotope used nuclear fuel uplutonium higher neutron yield per neutron

solved reprocessing much development work still requiredthorium fuel cycle commercialised effort required
seems unlikely abundant uranium available

nevertheless thorium fuel cycle potential breeding
fuel without need fast neutron reactor hold considerable
potential longterm thorium significantly abundanturanium key factor sustainability nuclear energy
