overview

perl generalpurpose programming language originally developedtext manipulation used wide range task including
system administration web development network programming gui
development
language intended practical easy use efficient
complete rather beautiful tiny elegant minimal major
feature include support multiple programming paradigm 
procedural objectoriented functional style automatic memory
management builtin support text processing large
collection thirdparty modules

features

overall structure perl derives broadly perlprocedural nature variable expression assignment
statement bracedelimited code block control structuresubroutines

perl also take feature shell programming variablemarked leading sigils unambiguously identify data type
scalar array hash etc variable context importantly
sigils allow variable interpolated directly string like
unix shell perl many builtin function common tasks
like sorting accessing system facilities

perl take list lisp associative array hash awkregular expression sed simplify facilitate many
parsing text handling data management tasks

perlfeatures added support complex data structures
firstclass function closure value objectoriented
programming model include reference package classbased
method dispatch lexically scoped variable along compiler
directive example strict pragma major additional feature
introduced perlwas ability package code reusable
module larry wall later stated whole intent perlmodule system encourage growth perl culture ratherperl core

version perl automatic data typing memory management
interpreter know type storage requirement every data
object program allocates free storagenecessary legal type conversion done automatically run time
illegal type conversion fatal errors

design

design perl understood response three broad
trend computer industry falling hardware cost rising labor
cost improvement compiler technology many earlier computer
language fortran designed make efficient use
expensive computer hardware contrast perl designed make
efficient use expensive computer programmers

perl many feature ease programmer task expense
greater cpu memory requirement include automatic memory
management dynamic typing string list hash regular
expression introspection eval function

wall trained linguist design perl much
informed linguistic principle example include huffman coding
common construction short good endweightingimportant information come first large collectionlanguage primitive perl favor language construct natural
human read write even complicate perl
interpreter

perl syntax reflects idea thing differentlook different example scalar array hashdifferent leading sigils array index hash key use different

standard delimiters approach contrasted languages

language structure

perl canonical hello world program ocassionally statedusrbinperl use strict
print hello worldnn newline

first line shebang tell operating systemfind perl interpreter second line introduces strict
pragma used many large software project quality
control third print string hello world newlinecommentn newlinefollows

thesign third line comment token allowsperl interpreter ignore everything thesign end
line code

shebang usual way invoke interpreter unix systems
window system may rely shebang may associate file extension perl interpreter text editor also use
shebang line hint mode operateprogram executed perl invoked via shell line
starting shebang parsed option otherwise ignored
detail see perlrun manpage

noted perl hello world program requiresvariable subroutine anything else would even potentially
violate strict pragma without causing fatal error without using
strict use strict restriction requirementhello world program reason use strictavoid potentially yelled programmer using
strict

perfectly possible invoke perl interpreter
directly command line additionally shebang linepart perl requirement shell treatedcomment perl shebang line also actually necessary
indeed win implementation completely useless

finally need explanatory comment insidedemonstrative hello world program additionally final lineblock code perl program includes implied block
around entire script doe actually need semicolon
terminator

thus reality perl canonical hello world programprint hello worldn

data types

perl four fundamental data type scalar list hashfilehandles
scalar single value may number stringreference
list ordered collection scalar variable holdlist called array
hash associative array map string scalarstring called key scalar called values
filehandle map file device pipe openreading writing
variable marked leading sigil identifies data
type accessed type variable except
filehandles arent name may used variabledifferent type without conflict

control structures

perl several kind control structures

ha blockoriented control structure similar cjava programming language condition surrounded parentheses
controlled block surrounded braces
label whilecond
label whilecondcontinue
label forinitexprcondexprincrexpr
label foreach varlist
label foreach varlistcontinue
ifcond
ifcondelse
ifcondelsifcondelse

single statement controlled statement modifiers
provide lighter syntax
statement ifcond 
statement unlesscond 
statement whilecond 
statement untilcond 
statement foreach list 

shortcircuit logical operator commonly used effect control
flow expression level
expr expr
expr orexpr

flow control keywords next last return redo expressions
used shortcircuit operators

perl also two implicit looping constructs
 resultsgreplist
 resultsmaplist

grep return element list controlled block
evaluates true map evaluates controlled block element
list return list resulting value constructs
enable simple functional programming style

switch statement multiway branch perlthe perl
documentation describes halfdozen way achieve effectusing control structure switch module however
provides functionality modeled forthcoming perl 
redesign

perl includes goto label statement rarely used situations
goto called language dont occur oftenperl due breadth flow control options

also goto sub statement performs tail callterminates current subroutine immediately call specified
sub used situation caller performefficient stack management perl typicallychange current stack required deep recursion tail
calling substantial positive impact performanceavoids overhead scopestack management return

subroutines

subroutine defined sub keyword invoked simplynaming subroutine question yet declared
parenthesis required proper parsing
fooparentheses requiredsub foo
foobut
list argument may provided subroutine name
argument may scalar list hashes
foo z

parameter subroutine need declared either number
type fact may vary call call array expanded
element hash expanded list keyvalue pairs

list scalars

whatever argument passed available subroutinespecial arraythe element ofare aliased actual

regular expressions

perl language includes specialized syntax writing regular
expression interpreter contains engine matching
string regular expression regular expression engine usbacktracking algorithm extending capability simple pattern
matching string capture substitution regular expression
engine derived regex written henry spencer

perl regular expression syntax originally taken unix
versionregular expression however diverged first
release perl since grown include many features
language application adopting perl compatible
regular expression posix regular expression including php ruby
java apache http server

match operator introduces regular expression matchleading may omitted brevity simplest caseexpression like
 xmabc

evaluates true string match regular
expression abc

portion regular expression may enclosed parentheses
corresponding portion matching string captured captured
string assigned sequential builtin variables
list captured string returned valuematch
 xmaccapture character 
substitute operator specifies search replace
operation
 xsabcabcupcase 
perl regular expression take modifier singleletter
suffix modify meaning expression
 xmabcicaseinsensitive pattern match
 xsabcabcgglobal search replace

regular expression dense cryptic regular
expression syntax extremely compact generally using single
character character pair represent operation perl
provides relief problem modifierallows programmer place whitespace comment inside regular
expressions
 xmamatchmatch character
cmatch x

one common use regular expression specify delimiterssplit operator
 wordssplit linedivide line commaseparated values

split operator complement string capture string capture returns
part string match regular expression split returns
part dont match
