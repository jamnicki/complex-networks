drafting offensive

hitler felt army still might able successfully defend
germany long term could somehow neutralizewestern front short term hitler believed could
split ally make american british sue separate
peace independent soviet union success west would give
german time design produce advanced weaponjet aircraft superheavy tank permit concentrationforce east assessment generally regardedunrealistic given allied air superiority throughout europeability intervene significantly german offensive operations

several senior german military advisor expressed concernfavourable weather would permit allied air power effectively stop
offensive action undertaken hitler ignored dismissedconcern though offensive intentionally scheduled late
autumn northwestern europe often covered heavy foglowlying cloud neutralize allied air forces

bagration strategic initiative briefly swung german givenreduced manpower german land force time believed
best way take advantage initiative wouldattack west smaller allied force deployedrather vast soviet force even unrealistic
encirclement destruction entire soviet army would stillleft soviet large numerical superiority also east
natural defensive line remained german control

west supply problem beginning significantly impede
allied operation even though opening antwerp november 
slightly improve situation allied army overextended
position ran southern france netherlands german
planning revolved around premise successful strikethinly manned stretch line would halt allied advanceentire western front

several plan major western offensive put forwardgerman high command quickly concentrated two first planencirclement maneuver called twoprong attack along borders

attack thinly defended ardennes splitting army along
usbritish line capturing antwerp blitzkrieg plandubbed wacht rhein watch rhine namedeceptive nature implying watch wait strategy western

hitler chose second plan believing successful encirclement
would little impact overall situation findingprospect splitting angloamerican army appealingdispute montgomery patton well known hitler
hoped could exploit perceived disunity attacksucceed capture port antwerp would trap four complete
army without supply behind german line hopedmight even bring repeat allied evacuation dunkirk
