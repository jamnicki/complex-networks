process called trophallaxis ant regurgitates food
previously held crop communal storage alsoadult distribute food amongst larva pupa needkept fairly constant temperature ensure proper developmentoften moved around various brood chamber within colony

ant communication accomplished primarily chemical called
pheromone ant spend time direct contactground chemical message developedhymenopteran instance forager find foodleave pheromone trail along ground way home hometypically located use remembered landmarkposition sun detected compound eye also meanspecial sky polarizationdetecting fiber within eyes

short time ant follow pheromone trail returning
home reinforce trail turn attracts ants
food exhausted trail longer
reinforced slowly dissipates

elementary behaviour explains ant adapt changeenvironment established path food source blockednew obstacle forager leave path explore new routesuccessful returning ant leaf new trail marking shortest
route since ant prefers follow path richer pheromone
rather poorer resulting route also shortest available

ant make use pheromone purpose well crushed ant
example emit alarm pheromone high concentration

merely attracts confuse enemy several ant species
even use termed propaganda pheromones
