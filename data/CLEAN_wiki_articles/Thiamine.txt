alphaketo acid tpp synthesized enzyme thiamine
pyrophosphokinase requires free thiamine magnesiumadenosine triphosphate

thiamine triphosphate thtp long considered specific neuroactive
form thiamine however recently shown thtp existsbacteria fungi plant animal suggesting much general
cellular role particular coli seems play roleresponse amino acid starvation
