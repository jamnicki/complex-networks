biotechnology technology based biology especially usedagriculture food science medicine conventionbiological diversity come one many definitionbiotechnology

biotechnology mean technological application uses
biological system living organism derivative thereofmake modify product process specific use

definition odds common usage united states
biotechnology generally refers recombinant dna based andor
tissue culture based process commercialized since
thus common usage modifying plant animalbreeding practiced thousand year wouldconsidered biotechnology distinction emphasizes modern
recombinant dna based biotechnology powerful version
existing technology represents something new differentinstance theoretically recombinant dna biotechnology allows utake virtually gene express organism takegene make crimson colour plant put guinea pigs
make pink pet take gene help arctic fish
survive freezing temperature put food increase
amount time grow freeze sort gene
transfer virtually impossible historical processes

ha great deal talkand moneypouredbiotechnology hope miracle drug appearseem small number efficacious drug generalbiotech revolution happened pharmaceutical sector
however recent progress monoclonal antibody based druggenentechs avastin suggest biotech may finally foundrole pharmaceutical sales

biotechnology also defined manipulation organismpractical thing provide useful products

one aspect biotechnology directed use organismmanufacture organic product example include beer milk
product another example naturally present bacteria utilized
mining industry bioleaching biotechnology also usedrecycle treat waste clean site contaminated industrial
activitiesbioremediation produce biological weapons

also application biotechnology use living
organism example dna microarrays used geneticsradioactive tracer used medicine

red biotechnology applied medical process exampledesigning organism produce antibiotic engineering
genetic cure genomic manipulation

white biotechnology also known grey biotechnology biotechnology
applied industrial process example designingorganism produce useful chemical white biotechnology tendsconsume resource traditional process used produce
industrial goods

green biotechnology biotechnology applied agricultural processes
example designing transgenic plant grow specific
environmental condition presence absence certain
agricultural chemical one hope green biotechnology might
produce environmentally friendly solution traditional
industrial agriculture example engineeringplant express pesticide thereby eliminating need external
application pesticide example would corn whether
green biotechnology product ultimatelyenvironmentally friendly topic considerable debate

bioinformatics interdisciplinary field address biological
problem using computational technique field also often
referred computational biology play key role various
area functional genomics structural genomicsproteomics form key component biotechnologypharmaceutical sector

term blue biotechnology also used describe marine
aquatic application biotechnology use relatively
rare

biotechnology medical products

traditional pharmaceutical drug small chemical moleculetreat symptom disease illnessone molecule directedsingle target biopharmaceuticals large biological molecule known
protein target underlying mechanism pathwaymalady relatively young industry deal targets

modern biotechnology often associated use genetically
altered microorganism coli yeast productionsubstance like insulin antibiotic also refer transgenic
animal transgenic plant corn genetically altered
mammalian cell chinese hamster ovary cho cell also
widely used manufacture pharmaceutical another promising new
biotechnology application development plantmade

biotechnology also commonly associated landmark breakthroughs
new medical therapy treat diabetes hepatitis hepatitis cancer arthritis haemophilia bone fracture multiple sclerosis
cardiovascular well molecular diagnostic device used
define patient population herceptin first drug approved
use matching diagnostic test used treat breast
cancer woman whose cancer cell express protein

early culture also understood importance using natural
process breakdown waste product inert form early
nomadic tribe preurban civilization common knowledgegiven enough time organic waste product would absorbedeventually integrated soil adventmodern microbiology chemistry process fully

practical use biotechnology still present today
cultivation plant produce food suitable humans
agriculture theorized become dominant wayproducing food since neolithic revolution processmethod agriculture refined mechanicalbiological science since inception early biotechnology
farmer able select best suited highyield cropproduce enough food support growing population usbiotechnology required crop field became increasingly
large difficult maintain specific organism organism
byproduct used fertilize restore nitrogen control pests
throughout use agriculture farmer inadvertently altered
genetics crop introducing new
environment breeding plant using artificial
selection modern time plant genetically modifiedproduce specific nutritional value economical

process ethanol fermentation also one first formbiotechnology culture mesopotamia egypt iran
developed process brewing consisted combining malted
grain specific yeast produce alcoholic beverageprocess carbohydrate grain broken alcohols
ethanol later culture produced process lactic
acid fermentation allowed fermentation preservationform food fermentation also used time periodproduce leavened bread although process fermentation wafully understood louis pasteur work init stillfirst use biotechnology convert food source another form

combination plant organism used medicationmany early civilization since early asbc people began use
disabled minute amount infectious agent immunizeinfection similar process refinedmodern medicine lead many development antibiotics
vaccine method fighting sickness

recent field biotechnology genetic engineering
genetic modification opened many new field biotechnologyallowed modification plant animal even humanmolecular level
