representation despite change many positionyear idea intentional attitude relational remained
unchanged original formulation present time

book attempted show mental representations
specifically sentence language thought necessaryexplain relational nature mental state fodor considers two
alternative hypothesis first completely denies relational

following path plowed linguist noam chomsky fodor developed
strong commitment idea psychological nativism nativismbelief innateness many cognitive function concepts
fodor position emerges naturally criticismbehaviourism associationism criticism also ledformulation wellknown hypothesis modularity mind

historically question mental architecture divided
two contrasting theory nature facultyfirst described horizontal view see mental
process interaction faculty domain
specific example judgement remains judgement whetherjudgement perceptual experience judgementunderstanding language second described vertical
view claim mental faculty domain specific
genetically determined associated distinct neurological
structure
vertical vision traced back century movement
called phrenology founder franz joseph gall gall claimedmental faculty could associated specific physical areabrain hence someone level intelligence example could
literally read size particular bumpposterior parietal lobe simplistic view modularity hadisproven course last century

fodor revived idea modularity without notion precise
physical localizability became onearticulate proponent thepublication monograph
modularity mind two property modularity particular
informational encapsulation domain specificity make possibletie together question functional architecture mental
content ability elaborate information independentlybackground belief individual two property allow
permit fodor give atomistic causal account notionmental content main idea word properties

fodors notion mental modularity informational encapsulationdomain specifity taken expanded muchchagrin cognitive scientist zenon pylyshynevolutionary psychologist steven pinker henry plotkin
among many others fodor complains pinker plotkinmember sarcastically call new synthesis taken
modularity similar idea way far insists mindmassively modular contrary researchers
would believe mind still long wayexplained computational model

intentional realism

theory content essaysfodor take another
central notion question reality mental
representation fodor need justify representational realismjustify idea content mental state expressedsymbolic structure lot

fodors criticism dennett

fodor start criticism socalled standard realismview characterized according fodor two distinct assertions
one regard internal structure mental stateasserts state nonrelational concernsemantic theory mental content assertsisomorphism causal role contentinferential web belief among modern philosopher mindmajority view seems first two assertionfalse second true fodor departs viewaccepting truth first thesis rejecting stronglytruth second

particular fodor criticizes instrumentalism daniel dennett
dennett maintains possible realist regardintentional state without commit oneself realitymental representation according fodor one remainslevel analysis possibility explainingintentional strategy works

isa standard objection instrumentalismdifficult explain psychology beliefsdesires works
well psychology beliefsdesires fact

conceptionof interpretation beliefsdesires

productivity compositionality thought

fodor also positive argument favour reality mental
representation term lot maintains languageexpression thought language systematic thoughts
must also systematic systematicity natural language tendsexplained term two basic concept productivitycompositionality fact systematicity productivity depend
compositional structure language mean language hacombinatorial semantics thought also combinatorial
semantics must language thought

second argument fodor provides favour representational
realism involves process thought argument touchrelation representational theory mind modelarchitecture sentence mentalese require unique processelaboration require computational mechanism certain
type syntactic notion mental representation hand hand

architecture based classic artificial intelligence passes

syntax rule regulate derivation one symbol another

nature content

beginning fodor adhered causal notion
mental content meaning idea content contrasts
sharply inferential role semantics fodor subscribed
earlier career fodor criticizes inferential role semantics
irs commitment extreme form holism excludespossibility true naturalization mental naturalization

antiholism

therefore two people never subsumedintentional generalization therefore intentional
generalization never successful thereforehope intentional psychology

criticism

many fodors idea challenged wide varietyphilosopher diverse orientation example languagethought hypothesis accused either falling preyinfinite regress superfluous specifically simon blackburn
suggested article inthat since fodor explains learning
natural language process formation confirmationhypothesis lot leaf open questionlot considered languagerequires yet another fundamental representational substrateform confirm hypothesis lotlearned natural language learning requires representational

yet another argument againt lot formulated daniel dennettbasic point argument would seembasis evidence behavior toward computer alsoregard unconscious behavior explicit
representation necessary explanation propositional
attitude game chess computer program often
attribute attitude computer saying thingthink queen moved left attribute
propositional attitude computer help explain
predict behaviour various context yet one would suggest
computer actually thinking believing somewhere inside
circuit equivalent propositional attitude believekick guy butt mentalese obviously true
suggests dennett many everyday automatic behaviordesiring breathe clear air stuffy environment

fodors selfproclaimed extreme concept nativism criticized
linguist philosopher language kent bach example
take fodor task criticism lexical semanticspolysemy fodor claim lexical structure verbs
keep get make put suggests alternatively
keep simply express concept keep fodor capitalizes conceptdistinguish property name entitystraightforward onetoone mapping individual words
concept keep clothes keep receipt keep
washing hand share concept keepfodors theory concept presumably lock unique external
property keeping true retain must pickdifferent property retain receipt since one cant retain ones
cloth retain washing one hand fodors theory also problem
explaining concept fast contributes differentlycontent fast car fast driver fast track fast time whether
differing interpretation fast sentencespecified semantics english result pragmatic

also need exist polysemic

make fodors view concept difficult acceptcritic simply insistence large perhaps
implausible number primitive undefinable example
fodor considers concept bachelor effect island trapezoid
