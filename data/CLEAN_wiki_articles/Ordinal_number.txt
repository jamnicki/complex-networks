furthermore element every ordinal ordinalwhenever two ordinal elementproper subset moreover either element
element equal every setordinal totally ordered fact much true every set
ordinal wellordered important result generalizes fact
every set natural number wellordered allows uuse transfinite induction liberally ordinals

another consequence every ordinal set elements
