usability

one chief usability problem floppy diskvulnerability even inside closed plastic housing disk mediumstill highly sensitive dust condensation temperature extremes
magnetic storage also vulnerable magnetic fields
blank floppy usually distributed extensive setwarning cautioning user expose conditionendanger
user damaging floppy disk content staplestupid user folklore among computer technician story poked
fun user stapled floppy paper made fax photocopies
asked copy disk stored floppy holdingmagnet file cabinet flexible inch disk could also
folklorically abused rolling typewriter typelabel removing disk medium plastic enclosure used
store safely

hand inch floppy also laudedmechanical usability hci expert donald norman

simple example good design inch magnetic diskette

hard plastic earlier type floppy diskplastic case protects magnetic material abusedamage sliding metal cover protects delicate magnetic surface
diskette use automatically opendiskette inserted computer diskette square
shape apparently eight possible way insertmachine one correct happenswrong try inserting disk sideways designer thought
little study show case really isnt square
rectangular cant insert longer side try backward
diskette part way small protrusions
indentation cutout prevent diskette inserted
backward upside eight way one might try insert
diskette one correct one fitexcellent design

floppy primary mean transferring datacomputer sometimes jokingly referred sneakernet frisbeenet
floppy disk also unlike hard disk handled seen evennovice user identify floppy disk although may changebecome common factor imagefloppy disk become metaphor saving data floppy
