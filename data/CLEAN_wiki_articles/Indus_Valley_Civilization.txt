agriculture

nature indus civilization agricultural system still
largely matter conjecture due limited amount information
surviving age speculation possible however

earlier study prior tooften assumed food productionimported indus valley single linguistic group aryans
andor single area recent study indicate food
production largely indigenous indus valley alreadymehrgarh people used domesticated wheat barley major
cultivated cereal crop naked sixrow barley crop derivedtworow barley see shaffer liechtenstein
archaeologist jim shafferwrites mehrgarh site
demonstrates food production indigenous south asian
phenomenon data support interpretationprehistoric urbanization complex social organization south asia
based indigenous isolated cultural developments

indus civilization agriculture must highly productivewa capable generating surplus sufficient support tens
thousand urban resident primarily engagedagriculture relied considerable technological achievements
preharappan culture including plough still little
known farmer supported cityagricultural method undoubtedly made use fertile
alluvial soil left river flood season simple
method agriculture thought productive enough support
city evidence irrigation evidence could
obliterated repeated catastrophic floods

indus civilisation appears contradict hydraulic despotism
hypothesis origin urban civilization state according
hypothesis early largescale civilization arosebyproduct irrigation system capable generating massive
agricultural surpluses

often assumed intensive agricultural production requires
dam canal assumption easily refuted throughout asia
rice farmer produce significant agricultural surplus terraced
hillside rice paddy result slavery ratheraccumulated labor many generation people instead building
canal indus civilization people may built water diversion
