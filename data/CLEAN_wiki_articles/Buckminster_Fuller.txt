family particular produced noted new england nonconformists
buckminster fuller father died boy wasspendingyouth bear island coast maine boynatural propensity design making thing often made
thing material brought home wood even
sometimes made tool notably experimented designingnew apparatus humanpowered propulsion small boat years
later decided sort experience providedinterest design habit fully familiarknowledgeable material ambitious later projects
would require actualization indeed fuller earned machinists
certification also knew fabricate using press brake

philosophy worldview

buckminster fuller strove inspire humanity take comprehensive
view finite world live infinite possibilityeverincreasing standard living within deploring wasteadvocated principle termedephemeralizationwhichessence according stewart brand fuller coined meanle wealth increased recycling resource newer
higher value product whose technically sophisticated design
requires material practice often meant
miniaturization example tablemodel calculating machines
succeeded time smaller one calculator today
fit one hand fuller also introduced synergetics explores
holistic engineering structure nature long term synergy
became popular

fuller one first propagate systemic worldview see 
operating manual spaceship earthsynergetics explored
principle energy material efficiency fieldarchitecture engineering design cited francois chardenedes

dedicated advancing success fulfillmenthumanity lived set selfdisciplines deeply
concerned sustainability human survivalexisting socioeconomic system yet profoundly optimistichumanity prospect defining wealth term knowledgetechnological ability protect nurture support accommodate

earth led conclude certain pointhumanity crossed unprecedented watershed

might otherwise sound like article faith spiritual
philosophical system fuller become objective factthat
accumulation relevant knowledge combined quantitykey recyclable resource already extractedearth reached critical level competitionnecessity longer necessary cooperation became optimum
survival strategy selfishness declared unnecessary
andunrationalizablewar obsolete

considering historical comparison like fact even
relatively poor people today able travel speeddegree comfort unobtainable price earlier
time illness fatal even king pastcured affordable drug concluded everyone alive
today potentially live like billionaire hence describedhuman race four billion billionaires

besides important comprehensiveness thought philosophical
concept fuller lasting insight may geometric claimed

member required stabilize object space deep confirming
result strongest possible homogeneous trusscyclically tetrahedral
