protocol commit reduce emission carbon dioxidefive greenhouse gas engage emission tradingmaintain increase emission gases

kyoto protocol cover thancountries globallyglobal greenhouse gas ghg emissions

heart kyoto establishes following principles
kyoto underwritten government governed global
legislation enacted aegis
government separated two general category developed
country referred annexcountries accepted ghg
emission reduction obligation developing country referred
nonannexcountries ghg emission reduction
obligations
annexcountry fails meet kyoto targetpenalized reduction target decreased byinnext period
byannexcountries reduce ghg emissions
aroundbelow theirlevels many countryeu member state corresponds somebelowexpected ghg emission inreduction target expire 
kyoto includes flexible mechanism allow annexeconomies
meet ghg target purchasing ghg emission reductions
elsewhere bought either financial exchanges
new emission trading scheme projects
reduce emission nonannexeconomies clean
development mechanism cdm annex countryji
cdm executive boardaccredited certified emission reductions
cer bought sold manner aegisun kyoto established bonnbased clean development mechanism
executive board ass approve project cdm projectnonannexeconomies prior awarding cer similar scheme
called joint implementation applies transitional
economy mainly covering former soviet union eastern
europe

mean practice nonannexeconomies ghg
emission restriction ghg emission reduction projectghg project implemented country ghg projectreceive carbon credit sold annexbuyers

kyoto linking mechanism place two main reasons
cost complying kyoto prohibitive many annex 
country especially country japannetherlands example highly efficient low ghg polluting
industry high prevailing environmental standard kyoto
therefore allows country purchase carbon credit instead
reducing ghg emission domesticallyseen mean encouraging nonannexdeveloping
economy reduce ghg emission sinceeconomically viable sale carbon credits

annexeconomies established designated national
authority manage ghg portfolio kyoto countries
including japan canada italy netherlands germany france spain
many actively promoting government carbon fundsupporting multilateral carbon fund intent purchasing carbon
credit nonannexcountries government organizationworking closely major utility energy oilgaschemical conglomerate try acquire many ghg certificatecheaply possible

virtually nonannexcountries also setdesignated national authority manage kyoto processspecifically cdm process whereby host government entities
decide ghg project wish supportaccreditation cdm executive board

objective opposing group quite different annex 
entity want carbon credit cheaply possible whilst nonannex 
entity want maximise value carbon credit generateddomestic ghg projects

costbenefit analysis

economist trying analyse overall net benefit kyoto
protocol costbenefit analysis caseclimatology disagreement due large uncertaintyeconomic variable still estimate far generally indicate
either observing kyoto protocol expensiveobserving kyoto protocol kyoto protocol marginal
net benefit exceeds cost simply adjusting global
warming study naturefound accounting local
external cost together production cost identify energy
strategy compliance kyoto protocol would imply lowerhigher overall costs

recent copenhagen consensus project found kyoto protocol
would slow process global warming superficial
overall benefit defender kyoto protocol argue howeverinitial greenhouse gas cut may little effect set
political precedent bigger effective cutfuture also advocate commitment precautionary principle
critic point additional higher curb carbon emissionlikely cause significantly higher increase cost makingdefence moot moreover precautionary principle could applypolitical social economic environmental consequence might
equally devastating effect term poverty environment
making precautionary argument irrelevant stern review government sponsored report economic impact climate
