programmer perspective

forth relies heavily explicit use data stack reverse polish
notation rpn postfix notation commonly used calculatorhewlettpackard rpn operator placed operandopposed common infix notation operator placed
operand postfix notation make language easierparse extend forth doe use bnf grammar doemonolithic compiler extending compiler requires writing new
word instead modifying grammar changing underlying
implementation

using rpn one could get result mathematical expression

operating system file multitasking

classic forth system traditionally use operating system file
system instead storing code file sourcecode stored disk
block written physical disk address word block employed

forth system implement contiguous disk file usingsystem disk access file located fixed disk block

self compilation cross compilation

fullfeatured forth system source code compiletechnique commonly called metacompilation forth programmers
although term doesnt exactly match metacompilationnormally defined usual method redefine handful words
place compiled bit memory compiler word use

area beginning different address code buffercompiler define word access target computer memoryhost compiling computer memory

fetch store operation redefined code space
compiler assembler etc recompiled using new definitions
fetch store effectively reuses codecompiler interpreter forth system code compiled

structure code

forth system body code definition consists either
machine language form threaded code traditionally
indirectthreaded code used directthreaded subroutine
threaded forth also popular fastest modern forth use
subroutine threading insert simple word macro perform
peephole optimization optimizing strategy make code
smaller faster

data objects

word variable data object pointruntime code associated defining word createddefining word characteristic defining behavior creatingdictionary entry plus possibly allocating initializing data space
also specifies behaviour instance class words
constructed defining word example include

variable
name uninitialized onecell memory location instance
behaviour variable return address stack

constant
name value specified argument constant instance
behaviour return value

create
name location space may allocated locationset contain string initialized value
instance behaviour return address beginningspace

forth also provides facility programmer define new
applicationspecific defining word specifying custom defining
behavior instance behaviour example include circular
buffer named bit port automaticallyindexed arrays

generally speaking forth program saved memory imagecompiled program single command run executed

development programmer interpreter executetest little piece developed forth programmers
therefore advocate loose topdown design bottomup development
continuous testing integration

topdown design usually separation programvocabulary used highlevel set tool write
final program welldesigned forth program read like natural
language implement single solution also settool attack related problems

toolbox approach one reason forth difficult
master learning syntax easy mastering tools
