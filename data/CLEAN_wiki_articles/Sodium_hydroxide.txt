uses

general applications

sodium hydroxide principal strong base used chemical
industry bulk often handled aqueous solution
since solution cheaper easier handle used drive
chemical reaction also neutralization acidic
material used also neutralizing agent petroleum
refining

experiment

sodium hydroxide also used conjunction zinccreation famous gold penny experiment penny boiledsolution naoh together granular zinc metal colour
penny turn silver aboutseconds pennyheld flame burner second turn golden
reason happens granular zinc dissolve naoh form
znoh zincate ion becomes reduced metallic zincsurface copper penny zinc copper heated flame form
brass

use chemical analysis

analytical chemistry sodium hydroxide solution often usedmeasure concentration acid titration since naohprimary standard solution must first standardised titration
standard khp burette exposed naohrinsed immediately use prevent freezing stopcock

soap making

soap making via saponification traditional chemical process
using sodium hydroxide arab began producing soap wayth century basic process still used today

biodiesel

manufacture biodiesel sodium hydroxide usedcatalyst transesterification methanol triglycerides
work anhydrous sodium hydroxide water lye
would turn fat soap would tainted methanol

used often potassium hydroxide cost less
smaller quantity needed result another
alternative sodium silicate

aluminium etching

strong base attack aluminium useful etchingresist converting polished surface satinlike finishwithout passivation anodizing allodizing surface
may become corroded either normal use severe atmospheric
conditions

food preparation

food lye include washing chemical peeling fruitvegetable chocolate cocoa processing caramel colour production
poultry scalding soft drink processing thickening ice cream

sodium hydroxide frequently used process decomposing
roadkill dumped landfill animal disposal contractors

framework sodium hydroxide also used criminalserial killer dispose victim bodies

illegal drugs

key ingredient process making
methamphetamine impossible purchase pure sodium hydroxide
consumer product united state product containing pure
sodium hydroxide red devil longer available sale
result amateur soapmakers must purchase sodium hydroxidebulk

safety

solid sodium hydroxide solution containing high concentrationsodium hydroxide may cause chemical burn permanent injuryscarring blindness

solvation sodium hydroxide highly exothermic resulting
heat may cause heat burn ignite flamables

combination aluminium sodium hydroxide result large
