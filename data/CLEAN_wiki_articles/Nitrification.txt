oxidation ammonia nitrite subsequent oxidationnitrate performed two different bacterianitrifying bacteria
first step done bacteria amongst others genus
nitrosomonas nitrosococcus second step oxidation nitrite
nitrate mainly done bacteria genus nitrobacter
organism autotroph mean take carbon dioxide
carbon source growth

nitrification also play important role removal nitrogen
municipal wastewater conventional removal nitrification
followed denitrification cost process resides mainlyaeration bringing oxygen reactor addition extra
organic energy source methanol denitrification

environment organism found together yielding
nitrate final product possible however design systems
selectively nitrite formed sharon process

together ammonification nitrification form mineralisation
