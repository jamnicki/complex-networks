content book

preface principia newton wrote

rational mechanic science motion resultingforce whatsoever force required producemotionand therefore offer work mathematical
principle philosophy whole burden philosophy seems
consist thisfrom phenomenon motion investigate
force nature force demonstratephenomenon 

wa perhaps force principia explained many
different thing natural world economy caused
method become synonymous physic even practised
almost three half century beginning today two
aspect newton outlined would called analysis synthesis

principia consists three books
de motu corporum motion body mathematical
exposition calculus followed statement basic dynamical
definition primary deduction based also
contains proposition proof littledynamic demonstrate kind problem solved
using calculus
first book divided second volumelength contains sundry application motionresistive medium derivation shape least resistancederivation speed sound account experimental tests
result
de mundi systemate system world essayuniversal gravitation build upon propositionprevious book applies motion observedsolar systemthe regularity irregularity orbit
moon derivation kepler law applicationmotion jupiter moon comet tide much data
came john flamsteed also considers harmonic
oscillator three dimension motion arbitrary force laws

sequence definition used setting dynamicprincipia exactly textbook today newton first
set definition mass

quantity matter arises conjointlydensity magnitude body twice dense double spacequadruple quantity quantity designate name body
mass

wa used define quantity motion today called
momentum principle inertia mass replacesprevious cartesian notion intrinsic force set stage
introduction force change momentumbody curiously today reader exposition looks
dimensionally incorrect since newton doe introduce dimension
time rate change quantities

defined space time well known instead
defined true time space absolute explained

must observe vulgar conceive quantitynotion relation bear perceptible
object convenient distinguish absolute
relative true apparent mathematical common 
instead absolute place motion use relative onewithout inconvenience common affairphilosophical discussion ought step back senses
consider thing distinctperceptible measure
interesting several dynamical quantity usedbook angular momentum given name dynamics
first two book selfevidently consistentimmediately accepted example locke asked huygens whether could
trust mathematical proof assured correctness

however concept attractive force acting distance
received cooler response note newton wrote inverse
square law arose naturally due structure matter howeverretracted sentence published version statedmotion planet consistent inverse square lawrefused speculate origin law huygens leibniz
noted law incompatible notion aethercartesian point view therefore faulty theory
newton defence adopted since many famous physicistshe
pointed mathematical form theory correct
since explained data refused speculatebasic nature gravity sheer mass phenomenon couldorganised theory impressive younger philosophers
soon adopted method language principia

mathematical language

reason newton use euclidean geometry mathematical
language choice principia puzzling two respect first
trouble today physicist trained modern analytical
method face following argument mathematical language
reportedly baffled richard feynman extent tried work
alternative euclidean proof satisfactionchandrasekhar one last major effort translatedprincipia modern mathematical language physicist today
read appreciate book founded modern physics

second puzzle historical newton revert euclidean
method seventeenth century mathematics increasingly used
descartes analytical geometry transaction newtonwritten earlier tract using language even earlier
communication calculus differential referred new
language fluxion invented fact early notebooks
suggest strongly learnt cartesian geometry long came
euclid commentator suggested newton usedmathematical language euclid order make rhetorical point
method followed easily greek tradition
however piece rhetoric unnecessary contemporaries
knew well general nature newton mathematical
discoveries
