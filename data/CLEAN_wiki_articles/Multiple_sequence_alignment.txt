progressive alignment construction

one method performing heuristic alignment searchprogressive technique also known hierarchical tree method
build final msa first performing series pairwise

begin aligning two closely related sequence firstsuccessively aligning next closely related sequencequery set alignment produced previous step initial
related pair determined efficient clustering method
neighbourjoining based simple heuristic searchquery set tool like fasta progressive technique therefore
automatically construct phylogenetic tree well alignment

one major limitation progressive method heavy dependence
initial assignment relatedness qualityinitial alignment method thus sensitive welldistribution sequence query set performance improvesrelatedness among query sequence relatively smooth gradient
rather distantly separated cluster performance also degrades
significantly sequence set rather distantly
