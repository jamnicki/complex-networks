orbit

first calculation comet orbit made scientists
realised comet going pas close earth 
march justau away three comet previous centurypassed closer comet halebopp already discussedpossible great comet took astronomical community
realise hyakutake might become spectacular close
approach earth meant likely become great comet

also encouraging comet chance becoming bright waorbit showed last returned inner solar systemyear ago meant likely passed closesun several time rather fresh arrivaloort cloud contains comet orbital period millionyear comet entering inner solar system first time may
brighten rapidly first fading near sun duelayer highly volatile material evaporated away wacase comet kohoutek inwhich initially touted comet
century appeared modestly bright older comet showconsistent predictable brightening pattern

besides approaching earth closely comet path also meantwould visible throughout night northern hemisphere
