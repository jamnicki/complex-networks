practical problems

loudness

despite size instrument relatively quiet primarily
due fact range low bass used
ensemble instrument orchestra usually four eight
bassist play part unison jazz blue settingbass normally amplified writing solo passage bass

smaller half quarter eighth even
sixteenthsized instrument became widely available meant
child could start younger age also teacher use
cello strung bass guitar string extremly young students
