albinism latin albus extended etymology technically
hypomelanism hypomelanosis form hypopigmentary congenital
disorder characterized lack melanin pigment eye skin

term organism affected albinism albino nounadjective word sometimes used derogatory way towards
people neutral term albinistic adjective person
albinism noun additional clinical adjective sometimes usedrefer animal albinoid albinic

people albinism enjoying outdoors especially using
sunglass andor brimmed hats

lack pigment also make skin unusually sensitive sunlight
thus susceptible sunburn people albinism either
avoid prolonged exposure bright sunlight protect skin
