early scientific career

pauling later traveled europe guggenheim fellowship study
german physicist arnold sommerfeld munich danish physicist
niels bohr copenhagen austrian physicist erwin schrdingerzrich three expert working new field quantum
mechanic branch physic studyingoregon agricultural college pauling first exposed ideaquantum theory quantum mechanic became interested seeing
might help understanding chosen field interest
electronic structure atom molecule europe paulingalso exposed one first quantum mechanical analysis bonding
hydrogen molecule done walter heitler fritz london
pauling devoted two year european trip workdecided make focus future research became onefirst scientist field quantum chemistry pioneerapplication quantum theory structure moleculetook new position assistant professor caltechtheoretical chemistry

pauling began faculty career caltech productive five
year continuing xray crystal study performing
quantum mechanical calculation atom molecule published
approximately fifty paper five year created five rules
known pauling rule inhe promoted associate
professor full professor bythe american
chemical society awarded pauling langmuir prizesignificant work pure science personyears ageyounger inpauling published regardedimportant paper first laid concepthybridization atomic orbitals analyzed tetravalencycarbon atom

caltech pauling struck close friendship theoretical
physicist robert oppenheimer spending part researchteaching schedule away berkeley caltech every year two men
planned mount joint attack nature chemical bond
apparently oppenheimer would supply mathematics pauling would
interpret result however relationship soured pauling
began suspect oppenheimer probably becoming closepauling wife ava helen pauling work oppenheimer
come place blurted invitation ava helenjoin tryst mexico although flatly refusedreported incident pauling apparent nonchalance
incident disquieted immediately cutrelationship berkeley professor leading coolnesswould last life although oppenheimer invite
pauling head chemistry division atomic bomb
project pauling refused saying pacifist

summer ofpauling made another european trip learning
use electron diffraction study similar ones
performed xrays student brockwaybuilt electron diffraction instrument caltech usedstudy molecular structure large number chemical substances

linus pauling introduced concept electronegativity 
using various property molecule energy required
break bond dipole moment molecule establishedscale associated numerical value elementpauling electronegativity scale useful predictingnature bond atom molecules

work nature chemical bond

began publishing paper nature chemical
bond leading famous textbook subject published

part pauling work nature chemical bond ledintroduction concept orbital hybridizationnormal think electron atom describedorbitals type etc turn describing
bonding molecule better construct functionpartake property thus one three orbitals carbon atom combined make four equivalent
orbitals called hybrid orbitals would appropriate
orbitals describe carbon compound methaneorbital may combined two orbitals make three
equivalent orbitals called hybrid orbitals remaining
p orbital unhybridized would appropriate orbitalsdescribe certain unsaturated carbon compound ethylenehybridization scheme also found type molecules

another area explored relationship ionic
bonding electron transferred atom covalent
bonding electron shared atom equal basis
pauling showed merely extremeactual case bonding fall especially paulings
electronegativity concept particularly usefulelectronegativity difference pair atom surest
predictor degree ionicity bond

third topic pauling attacked overall heading
nature chemical bond accountingstructure aromatic hydrocarbon particularly prototype
benzene best description benzene made german
chemist friedrich kekul treated rapid interconversion
two structure alternating single double bonds
