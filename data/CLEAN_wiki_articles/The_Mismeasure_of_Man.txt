statistical correlation heritability

gould devotes large part book analysis statistical
correlation used psychologist assert validityiq test heritability intelligence example claim
iq test measure general intelligence factor relies fact
answer various question correlate highlyheritability requires score respondentclosely related exhibit higher correlation distant
relation criticise claim gould point correlation
cause put measure changetime age population mexico price swiss cheese
pet turtle weight average distance galaxyhigh positive correlation doe mean stephen jay
gould age population mexico second
specifically high positive correlation parentchild taken either evidence genetically
inherited inherited social environmental
factor since data used argue either sidecase data useful

furthermore gould argues even demonstrated iqhighly genetically heritable within group tell nothingcause difference group whetherdifference changed environment gould give exampleheight known determined mostly gene within
socioeconomic group group difference height may duenutrition well gene richard lewontin colleague goulds
wellknown emphasizing argument pertains testing

according gould good example confusion heritabilityfound statement environment become equaleveryone heritability would rise tobecause remaining
difference would necessarily genetic origin sayclaim best misleading worst false firsthard conceive world everyone grows exact

gould argues heritability measure phenotypic
difference group rather difference genotypephenotype within population even within group membergroup grow exactly environment doe mean
heritability isall american new yorkersupperclass new yorkersone may define population questionnarrowly one like may eat exactly food adult
height still result genetics nutrition short
heritability almost neverand heritability tell nothing

heritability gould discuss

gould profound criticism rejection thingiq meant measure general intelligence iq testpoint ask many different kind question responsedifferent kind question tend form cluster words
different kind question given different scoreswhich
suggests test really combination numberdifferent test test number different thing gould claims
proponent test assume thinggeneral intelligence analyze data produce one number
claim measure general intelligence gould
argues one number therefore implicationreal thing called general intelligence number
measure fact artifact statistical operations
psychologist apply raw data argues one analyzedata effectively end number different scores
