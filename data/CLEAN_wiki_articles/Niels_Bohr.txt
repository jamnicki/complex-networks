anyone think talk quantum theory without
feeling dizzy hasnt yet understood first thingquantum mechanic hasnt profoundly shocked havent
understood yet
nothing exists measured
triviality statement whose opposite false howevergreat truth statement whose opposite may well another great
truth
theory crazy crazy enough true
wonderful met paradoxhope making progress
einstein stop telling god sometimes quoted
including dice
alternate version dont think caution needed using
ordinary language ascribe attribute god
complement truth clearness
difficult make accurate prediction especially
future
expert person made mistakemade narrow field
never talk faster think
thing serious laugh
