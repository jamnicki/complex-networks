etymology

word galaxy derives greek term galaxy
galaxiasor kyklos galaktikos meaning milky circlesystem appearance sky greek mythology zeus placed son
mortal woman infant hercules hera breastasleep baby would drink divine milk thus become
immortal hera woke breastfeeding realizednursing unknown baby pushed baby away jet milk
sprayed night sky

astronomer speculated certain object previously classified
spiral nebula actually vast congeries starcalled theisland universe theory obvious misnomer
since universe mean everything consequently term fell
disuse replaced applying term galaxy genericallybodies
