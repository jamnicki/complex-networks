called daltonism although term used type colour

treatment management

generally treatment cure color deficiency however
certain type tinted filter contact lens may helpindividual distinguish different color better additionally
software developed assist visual colour

design implication colour blindness

good graphic design avoids using color coding color contrast alone
express information help colour blind peoplealso aid understanding normally sighted people usecascading style sheet world wide web allows page given
alternative color scheme colourblind reader colour
scheme generator help graphic designer see color scheme seeneight type color blindness need process visual
information rapidly possible arises example trainaircraft crash visual system may operate shade grey
extra information load adding colour droppedimportant possibility consider designing example
