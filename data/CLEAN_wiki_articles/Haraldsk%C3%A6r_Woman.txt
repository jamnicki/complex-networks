bog chemistry

limited number bog existed millennia
correct condition preservation mammalian tissue
bog occur northern europe approximately 
ancient body discovered yearthese bogformed area lack drainage hence little freshwater

subsurface aerobic organism opportunity initiate tissue
decay process modern experimenter able mimic bog
condition laboratory demonstrate preservation process

bog chemistry environment involves completely saturated acidic
