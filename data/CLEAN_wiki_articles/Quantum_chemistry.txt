electronic structure

first step solving quantum chemical problem usually solving
schrdinger equation dirac equation relativistic quantum
chemistry electronic molecular hamiltonian called
determining electronic structure molecule said
electronic structure molecule crystal implies
essentially chemical properties

wave model

foundation quantum mechanic quantum chemistry wave
model atom small dense positively charged nucleus
surrounded electron unlike earlier bohr model atom
however wave model describes electron asclouds movingorbitals position represented probability
distribution rather discrete point strength model
lie predictive power specifically predicts patternchemically similar element found periodic table wave model
named electron exhibit property interference
traditionally associated wave see waveparticle duality
