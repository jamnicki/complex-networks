rarity fossils

fossilization actually rare occurrence componentformerlyliving thing tend decompose relatively quickly following
death order organism fossilized remains normally
need covered sediment soon possible howeverexception organism becomes frozen desiccated
come rest anoxic oxygenfree environmentbottom lake several different type fossilfossilization processes

due combined effect taphonomic process simple
mathematical chance fossilization tends favour organism hard
body part widespread lived long
time hand unusual find fossil small
soft bodied geographically restricted geologically ephemeral
organism relative rarity low likelihoodpreservation

larger specimensmacrofossils often observed dugdisplayed although microscopic remainsmicrofossils actually
far common fossil record

casual observer perplexed rarity transitional
specie within fossil record conventional explanationrarity given darwin stated extreme imperfection
geological record combined short duration narrow
geographical range transitional specie made unlikely many
fossil would found simply put conditionfossilization take place quite rare highly unlikely
