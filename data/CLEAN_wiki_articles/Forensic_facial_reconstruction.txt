radiograph ante mortem photograph skull method
usually requires collaboration artist forensic
anthropologist recently developed face cares
computer software program quickly produce twodimensional facial
approximation edited manipulated relative ease
program help speed reconstruction process allow subtle
variation applied drawing

technique creating clay reconstruction

note standard method creating threedimensional forensic
facial reconstruction widely agreed upon multiple
method technique used process detailed reflects

method assumes sex age race remains undergo
facial reconstruction already determined traditional
forensic anthropological techniques

skull basis facial reconstruction howeverphysical remains sometimes available often provevaluable occasionally remnant soft tissue found setremains close inspection forensic artist easily
approximate thickness soft tissue remaining areas
skull based presence tissue eliminates

problem facial reconstruction

insufficient tissue thickness data

multiple outstanding problem associated forensic facial
reconstruction probably pressing issue relates data
used average facial tissue thickness data available forensic
artist still limited range age sex body
build disparity greatly affect accuracy reconstructions
data expanded likelihood producingaccurate reconstruction possible largely limited

lack methodolocial standardization

second problem lack methodological standardizationapproximating facial feature individuating characteristics
forensic anthropologist artist published individual
technique used practice however single official
method reconstructing face yet recognized also
present major setback facial approximation facial features
like eye nose individuating characteristic like hairstyle
feature likely recalled witnesseslackstandard way reconstructed without consistency standard
method approximating feature remain difficult
forensic reconstruction earn wide recognition legitimate
form forensic identification

subjectivity

reconstruction reveal type face person mayexhibited artistic subjectivity position general
shape main facial feature mostly accurategreatly determined skull subtle detail like certain
wrinkle birthmark skin fold shape nose ear etc
unavoidably speculative skeletal remains leave evidence
appearance success reconstruction depends much upon
circumstance pertaining subject investigationdoe upon accuracy technique
