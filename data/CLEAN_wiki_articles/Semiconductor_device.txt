history semiconductor device development


semiconductor used electronics field time
invention transistor around turn century quite common detector radio used device
called acats whisker detector somewhat troublesome
however requiring operator move small tungsten filamentwhisker around surface galena lead sulfide carborundum
silicon carbide crystal suddenly started workingperiod hour day cat whisker would slowly stop
working process would repeated timeoperation completely mysterious introductionreliable amplified vacuum tube based radio cat whisker
system quickly disappeared cat whisker primitive example
special type diode still popular today called schottky
diode

world war 
world war radar research quickly pushed radar receiveroperate ever higher frequency traditional tube based radio
receiver longer worked well introduction cavity
magnetron britain united state induring tizard
mission resulted pressing need practical highfrequency
amplifier

whim russell ohl bell laboratory decided try cats
whisker point use number years
one lab one hunting one used radio
store manhattan found worked much better tubebased
systems

ohl investigated cat whisker functioned well spent
oftrying grow pure version crystal soon
found higher quality crystal finicky behaviour went
away ability operate radio detector one day
found one purest crystal nevertheless worked wellinterestingly clearly visible crack near middle however
