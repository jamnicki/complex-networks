richard feynman contended space travel never achieved
major scientific breakthrough however others counterarguedmany indirect scientific achievement developmentmodern computer laser etc

critic contend light huge distance space
human space travel never able achieve earth
orbit best visit closest neighbour solar systemeven consume large amount money require complex
spacecraft accommodate handful people supporters
human space travel state irrelevant real
value lie providing focal point national prestigepatriotism suggest reason clinton
administration cooperated closely russia international
space station gave russia something take pridebecame stabilizing factor postcommunist russia point
view justifiable cash outlay

people also moral objection huge cost space
travel point even fraction space travel budget
would make huge difference fighting disease hungerworld however compared much costly endeavor like military
action space exploration receives small percentagetotal government spending nearly always 

overall public remains largely supportive mannedunmanned space exploration according associated press poll
