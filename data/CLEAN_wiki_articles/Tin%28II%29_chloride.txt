chemical properties

tinii chloride dissolve mass water
without apparent decomposition solution diluted
hydrolysis occurs form insoluble basic salt

therefore clear solution tinii chloride used
hydrochloric acid must added order maintain equilibrium
towards lefthand side using chateliers principle solutions
sncl also unstable towards oxidation air

organic chemistry sncl mainly used stephen reduction
whereby nitrile reduced via imidoyl chloride salt imine
easily hydrolysed aldehyde reaction usually works
best aromatic nitrile arylcn related reaction calledsonnmller method start amide treated pcl
form imidoyl chloride salt
stephen reduction

stephen reduction used today mostly
superseded diisobutylaluminium hydride reduction

additionally sncl used selectively reduce aromatic nitro
group anilines

sncl also reduces quinone hydroquinones
