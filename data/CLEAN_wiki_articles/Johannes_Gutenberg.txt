gutenberg technique making movable type remains unclearfollowing decade punch copper matrix became standardizedrapidly disseminating printing press across europe whether
gutenberg used sophisticated technique somewhat primitive
version subject considerable debate

standard process making type hard metal punchletter carved back front hammered soft metal copper
creating mould matrix placed holder cast

letter type appearing anywhere bookappear similar giving rise growth font subsequentlyletter placed rack inked using press many hundred
copy made letter reused combination

wa type produced punch copper matrices

process widely attributedgutenberg invention appears recent evidencegutenberg actual process somewhat different used punch
matrix approach letter identical within
variation possibly due inking however type usedgutenberg printed bible quite irregular

hyphen made clear variation couldntcome either ink smear wear damage piecemetal type identical type clearly

analysis made one conclusion couldproduced matrix hypothesized method used
involved using punch make mould processtaking type would disturb mould resulting nonidentical

thus feel decisive factor birth typography

chapterthey suggest additional step using punchcreate mould could reused many time taken 
year later
hypotheses

th printer typefounder fournier jeune suggestedgutenberg might using type cast reusable matrix
possibly wooden type carved individually howeverappears unlikely given uniformity bulk type used

ha also questioned whether gutenberg used movable typeinitalian professor bruno fabbiani claimed examination
line bible revealed overlapping letter suggesting
gutenberg fact use movable type individual cast
character rather used whole plate made system somewhat
like modern typewriter whereby letter stamped successively
plate printed however specialist regardoccasional overlapping type caused paper movement pieces
type slightly unequal height
