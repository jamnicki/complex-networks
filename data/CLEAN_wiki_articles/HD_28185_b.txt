hdb extrasolar planet orbiting sunlike star 
planet located nearcircular orbit star habitable
zone hdb discovered inas part coralie survey
southern extrasolar planets

discovery

orbit mass

hdb takesyears orbit parent star unlike known
long period planet orbit hdb low eccentricity
comparable mar solar system orbit lie entirely
within star habitable zone

amplitude radial velocity oscillation mean planet
ha mass leasttimes jupiter solar system
however radial velocity method yield minimum valueplanet mass depending orbital inclination linesight therefore true mass planet may much greaterlower limit

characteristics

given planet high mass likely gas giantsolid surface since planet detected indirectly
observation star property radius
composition temperature unknown

since hdb orbit star habitable zonespeculated possibility life world hdsystem
unknown whether gas giant support life simulationtidal interaction suggest hdb could harbour earthmass
satellite orbit around many billion year moons
exist may able provide habitable environment though
unclear whether satellite would form first place
additionally small planet one gas giant trojan points
could survive habitable orbit long periods
