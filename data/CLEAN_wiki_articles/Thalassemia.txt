actual genetic cause ofthalassemias actually diverse
number different mutation cause reduced absent 
globin synthesis usually superscriptsandare added toto
indicate complete absence deficient synthesis ofglobins
respectively

mainly two form genetic defect produce 
thalassemias
nondeletion form defect generally involve single base
substitution small deletion insert near upstream 
globin gene commonly mutation occur promoter regions
preceding betaglobin gene often abnormal splice
variant believed contribute disease
deletion form deletion different size involving theglobin
gene produce different syndrome hereditary
persistence fetal hemoglobin syndromes

treatment complications

anyone thalassemia consult properly qualified
hematologist

thalassemia minor

contrary popular belief thalassemia minor patient avoid
ironrich food default serum ferritin test determineiron level guide treatment necessary
thalassemia minor although life threatening affect
quality life due effect mild moderate anaemia
study shown thalassemia minor often coexistsdisease asthma even bipolar disorder

benefits

carrier disease may confer degree protection
malaria quite common among people italian greek
origin also african indian region probably
making red blood cell susceptible lethal
specie plasmodium vivax simultaneously making host rbc
environment unsuitable merozoite lethal strain
plasmodium falciparum believed selective survival
advantage patient various thalassemia traitrespect resembles another genetic disorder sicklecell disease

epidemiological evidence kenya suggests another reason protection
severe anaemia may advantage

people diagnosed heterozygous carrier betathalassemiaprotection coronary heart disease
