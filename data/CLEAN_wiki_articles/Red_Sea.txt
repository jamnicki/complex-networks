name sea doe indicate color waterred colour may signify seasonal bloomredcolored cyanobacteria trichodesmium erythraeum near water
surface suggest refers mineralrich red mountains
nearby called harei edomedom meaning ruddy
complexion also alternative hebrew name redfaced
biblical character esau brother jacob nation descended
edomites turn provides yet another possible
origin red sea

also speculation name red sea camemistranslation reed sea biblical
account exodus

another hypothesis name come himarites local
group whose name mean red

yet another theory favored modern scholar name redreferring direction south way black sea name may
refer north basis theory asiatic languages
used colour word refer cardinal directions

final theory suggests named borders
egyptian desert ancient egyptian called dashretred land therefore would sea red land
