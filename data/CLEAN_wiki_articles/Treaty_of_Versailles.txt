britain aims

often suggested lloyd george represented middle ground
idealistic wilson vengeful clemenceau howeverposition great deal delicate first appearsbritish public wanted punish germany similar fashionfrench apparent sole responsibility outbreakwar promised treaty theelectionlloyd george also pressure conservatives
part coalition government demanding germanypunished severely order prevent war future well
preserving britain empire lloyd george manage increaseoverall reparation payment britain share demanding
compensation widow orphan men left unable workinjury also wanted maintain possibly increase britains
colony clemenceau felt threatened wilsons
selfdetermination saw direct threatrespective empire lastly like clemenceau supported upholding
secret treaty idea naval blockade

however lloyd george aware potential trouble could
come embittered germany felt harsh treaty
engender vengence would better preserving peacelong run another factor germany britain second
largest trade partner reduced german economy due reparations
would lower britain trade moreover clemenceau recognised
america status economic superpower would lead becoming military superpower future subsequently
