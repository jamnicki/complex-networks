hunting

spotted hyena example cooperative formhunting dictated type prey well predators
ability hunt kill different type prey hyena hunt
animal bigger may hunt packtake prey biting dragging groundsmaller prey hunt alone foxlike matter

like dog unlike animal habitat hyenakill prey directly chased prey exhaustion
prey unable mount defencecaptured eaten still alive although somewhat distasteful
human perspective speedy disembowelment prey means
death often come sooner method employedpredator example suffocation efficient meaneating lessens probability kill lost another
predator

hyena adapt specific hunting strategy environmentlive ngorogoro crater richconcentrated amount prey relatively many great beasts
wildebeest zebra animal much bound one
place dont migrate hyena live large clan 
andmembers per clan established hunting territoryoften defend neighbouring clan amount large prey
animal make cooperative hunting necessary serengeti
example clan often arent large must follow
herd migrate hyena following migrating prey less
territorial often hunt small animal individually welllarge one pack hunting pack proven effective
fast hunting alone especially large prey animals

fighting

hyena within clan rarely fight way damageseriously bickering settled quickly even membersimilar ranking social hierarchy loud noise couple
light bite usually enough fight ever gethand quite normal hyena higher rank stepinterrupt fight

even hyena strange would rather avoid battle
recklessly try kill usually scent marking
territory avoids conflict lone hyena enter hostile
territory anyway keep low profile stay borders
female hyena treated hostility male since males
different clan needed breeding clan strangerrarely accepted clan usually placedbottom ranking system

clan member spot intruder quickly start scent
marking make intruder aware welcome
furthermore clan member raise tail make whooping noise
warn rest clan typically intruder slink away
physical contact made

situation different however come two clans
fighting rule much one clan
intruding hostile territory hyena clan may try takeweaker clan territory lack prey peaceterritory human interaction among reason hyena clanhuman activity often cause hyena territory shrink
reduce available prey population

member defending clan spot enemy clan come
close call whole clan together cub sentden selected adult female stay guardadult male female huddle together bristling maneraised tail making rumbling giggle form kind wall
keep intruder reaching territoryimportantly cub defender stand groundoccasionally one defending hyena rush attack enemies
defender typically follow always hyenas
holding ground making sure intruder pasattacker try push forward well possibledefender try spread typically lunge hyenastarted attack provoke others make unsure

fight clan actually based strict set ruleoften portrayed brutal reckless hyena clan often
coordinate attack winning clan usually biggernumerous one necessarily clan membermember extremely bold may gain upper hand

rule slightly different come two clan neutral
territory typically defending stealing killsince isnt valuable territory young cub battlenormally short winner oftengroup members

nevertheless normal circumstance clan confrontationrare compared many confrontation clan liondefending territory den behaviour similarclan attacked hyena increased attentioncub though since lion often pay visit hyena territory kill
offspring

hyena huddle together form wall naturally
easier lion break wall bulkhyena quickly form soon spread hyenas
attack lion stay defense
trying tire big cat
hyena numerous enough however lunge forward aim
lion hindquarter try rip haunch bite

hyena attacker killlion offspring come large number distractingadult lion couple quick hyena snatch cub least
four hyena needed chase lioness least six
hyena required even confrontation adult male lion
biting tearing behind preferred rather facing
big cat deadly claws

similar behaviour seen stealing kill hyena quite
successful defending kill hyena loserlion involved since dont hunt extremely large grouprather prefer kill several time night lion often
come large raiding party make sure steal hyenas
prey however hyena learned deal usuallyfortunate enough call clan together takeprey back unless adult male lion present male lion seemtruly terrify hyena hyena rarely challenge
