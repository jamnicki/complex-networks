paleocene climate

early paleocene slightly cooler preceding cretaceous
though temperature rose late epoch climate warm
humid worldwide subtropical vegetation growing greenland
patagonia pole cool temperate north america
europe australia southern south america warm temperate
tropical climate characterized equatorial area north south

paleocene paleogeography

paleocene flora

terrestrial paleocene stratum immediately overlying boundaryplace marked fern spike bed especially rich fern
fossil fern often first specie colonize area damagedforest fire thus fern spike may indicate post chicxulub

general paleocene marked development modern plant
specie cactus palm tree appeared paleocene later plant
fossil generally attributed modern genus closely related
taxa

warm temperature worldwide gave rise thick tropical
subtropical deciduous forest cover around globe first

mammals

mammal first appeared triassic developed alongsidedinosaur exploiting ecological niche untouched largerfamous mesozoic animal insectrich forest underbrushhigh tree smaller mammal well birds
reptile amphibian insect survived mass extinctionend cretaceous wiped dinosaur mammals
diversified spread throughout world

early mammal small nocturnal animal herbivorousinsectivorous diet demise dinosaur beginningpaleocene saw mammal growing bigger ferocious finally
becoming dominant predator spreading throughout world ten
million year death dinosaur world filled
rodentlike mammal medium sized mammal scavenging forests
large herbivorous carnivorous mammal hunting mammals
bird reptiles

paleocene mammal yet specialized teeth limbbrain body mass ratio quite low compared later
form considered primitive archaic waeocenema true modern mammal developed

fossil evidence paleocene scarce relatively
little known mammal time small sizea
constant late epochearly mammal bonewellpreserved fossil record know comes
fossil teeth much tougher substance skeletons

mammal paleocene include
monotreme three specie monotreme survived modern
time duckbilled platypus two specie echidnas
monotrematum sudamericanum lived paleocene
marsupial modern kangaroo marsupial characterizedgiving birth embryonic baby crawl mother pouch
suckle developed bolivian pucadelphys
andinus paleocene example
multituberculates extinct mammalian familyrodentlike grouping includes paleocene ptilodus
placental grouping mammal became diversesuccessful member include hoofed ungulate primatecarnivore paleocene mesonychid

reptiles

due climatic condition paleocene reptilewidely distributed globe present amongsubtropical reptile found north america epochchampsosaurs aquatic reptile resemble modern gharials
crocodilian softshelled turtle palaeophid snake varanid lizards
protochelydra zangerli similar modern snapping turtles

example champsosaurs paleocene include champsosaurus gigas
largest champsosaur ever discovered creature unusual
among paleocene reptile gigas became larger known
mesozoic ancestor gigas twice lengthlargest cretaceous specimensmeters versusmeters reptilewhole decreased size event champsosaurs declined
towards end paleocene became extinct endeocene

birds

bird began diversify epoch occupying new nichemodern bird type appeared midcenozoic including perching
bird crane hawk pelican heron owl duck pigeon loons
woodpeckers

large carnivorous flightless bird also called terror birdfound late paleocene fossil including fearsome gastorniseurope

early owl type ogygoptynx berruornis appear late
paleocene france respectively

paleocene oceans

warm sea circulated throughout world including poleearliest paleocene featured low diversity abundance marine
life trend reversed later epoch tropical conditions
gave rise abundant marine life including coral reefdemise marine reptile end cretaceous shark became
top predator end cretaceous also saw extinctionammonite many specie foraminifera

marine fauna also came resemble modern fauna marine
