hawking radiation remains controversial 

overview

black hole site immense gravitational attractionsurrounding matter drawn gravitational force classicallygravitation powerful nothing even radiation light
hence black light reflecting escape
black hole however calculation framework
quantum field theory curved spacetimes hawking showedquantum effect allow black hole emit radiation thermal
spectrum

physical insight process may gained imaginingparticle antiparticle radiation emitted beyond event
horizon radiation doe come directly black hole
rather result virtual particle boostedblack hole gravitation becoming real particles

precise still much simplified view processvacuum fluctuation cause particleantiparticle pair appear close
event horizon black hole one pair fallblack hole whilst escape order fill energy hole
left pair spontaneous creation energy tunnelblack hole across event horizon process black hole
loses mass outside observer would appear black
hole emitted particle

example

black hole one solar mass temperature 
nanokelvins fact black hole would absorb far cosmic
microwave background radiation emits black holekg mass moon would equilibriumkelvin absorbing much radiation emits yet smaller
primordial black hole would emit absorb thereby
lose mass

problem theory

transplanckian problem may raise doubt physical validity
hawking result hawking original derivation employed field modes
arbitrarily high frequency near black hole horizon although
appear final result particular used modes
frequency higher inverse planck time scales
