relation darwinism

sudden appearance lack substantial gradual changespecie geologic recordfrom initial appearanceextinctionhas long noted including charles darwin
appealed imperfection record
favored explanation nevertheless influencecatastrophism darwin needed forcefully stress gradual natureevolution often incorrectly assumed insistedrate change must constant nearly origin species
darwin wrote period specie undergone

russel wallace

according theory punctuated equilibrium peripheral
isolates considered critical importance speciation
however darwin wrote mean agreethat immigrationisolation necessary elementsalthough isolation great
importance production new specie whole inclined
believe largeness area still important especially
production specie shall prove capable enduringlong period spreading widely 

darwin explained reason belief follows

throughout great open areagreater chance favourable variation arising large
number individual specie supportedcondition life much complex large
number already existing specie species
become modified improved others improvedcorresponding degree exterminated new
form also soon improved ablespread open continuous area thus come
competition many formsthe new forms
produced large area already victoriousmany competitor spread widely
give rise greatest number new varietyspecie thus play important rolechanging history organic world 

thus punctuated equilibrium contradicts darwin ideas
regarding specific mechanism evolution generally accords
darwin theory evolution natural selection
